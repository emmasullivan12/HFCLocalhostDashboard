I originally started working in R&amp;D and made plugins in C++ for Maya for soft body simulation, procedural generation and various other things. Since Jan, I am now an Assistant Technical Director working to help artists on shows develop tools. Because my role is so broad, I have access to all the different kinds of departments and know how they work in the visual effects pipeline. I also happen to know an ATD that went into FX in March and another that plans to move to FX soon! Our software for the FX department is solely Houdini :slightly_smiling_face: Not sure what you want to know but ask me anything at all!",

So actually a 2nd year student I am mostly worried about the opportunity to get an internship for the summer and I am trying to make as much research as possible to find out what companies expect to see in showreels. We have to think of a 2nd year film we gonna make for Sem B in Uni and we need to think really carefully with ideas to make group members showreels stand out, now we are making an idea for Live action film with an animal. The thing is, I have to think of an idea which is something interesting and haven’t been done many times, but when I look in companies’ showreels I mostly see simulations like explosions and particle sims, but making something like that into showreel feels like it has been done a lot before. So maybe you could give any advice what would Framestore expect to see from students who tries to get an internship as a FX artist ? :slightly_smiling_face:",
