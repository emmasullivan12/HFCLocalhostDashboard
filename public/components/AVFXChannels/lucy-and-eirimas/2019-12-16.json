Sure send away any work you have :slightly_smiling_face: With Roto\/Paint, it is a role in itself rather than being solely for Junior Compositors. Usually, people start off in Paint Roto as an entry level role to the industry, which usually leads to a career in compositing but it also may go somewhere else. It is also the same for tracking - I have a friend who is currently in that dept and she wants to eventually go to texturing. For Junior FX, I'd say you still get to start actually generating simulation - my friend who started in FX was assigned to doing the drool for the dogs in Lady and the Tramp haha, if that gives you some idea. It definitely won't be crazy hard effects and it'll more likely be tweaking values and pre-existing setups rather than anything full on which requires scripting, to ease you into the role and get you used to the company's vfx pipeline.",
