I hope you're well rested for the new semester. It's looking good so far! I'll focus on the FX part and say for the editing itself, perhaps show your render first before adding the reference footage. I think it is a little bit long and maybe you only need to include a thumbnail of it instead of it on the whole screen. Also it'd be cool for you to expand your work into adding new components like a plate taken from real-life footage and some house destruction. It reminded me of this project I saw on fxphd <https:\/\/www.fxphd.com\/details\/491\/> if that may give you some inspiration :slightly_smiling_face: Really great work so far, hope this semester is more exciting for you with the FX work!",

Numerous applications will be used throughout the course, including 3D Equalizer, Maya, Houdini, Arnold Renderer, and NUKE.",
