Yeah the perspective is a big thing, I keep remembering Martin Luther Kings \"maladjusted speech\".\n\nBookwise I recently read \"The Three Body Problem\" which is a Chinese scfi and really cool, very different perspective from most of what I've read. Also the Rosewater Trilogy, also scifi, this time set in Nigeria (British Nigerian author).\n\nI love Greek mythology and actually did Classical Civilisation A Level. If you can find a good translation of their plays as audio book Euripides and Sophocles are actually really accessible (lots of translations go for \"Thespian\" rather than modern English). \n\nNeil Gaiman is great for mythology esp Sandman graphic novels, American Gods and his Viking mythology book is great.",
