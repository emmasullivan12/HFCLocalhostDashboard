        "text": "Hi thee, so in advertising and TV work there is definitely less time to iterate and you have to knock out shots super fast (having said that high end Netflix, HBO stuff can almost be like film). Molinare is unusual in that it is a full post house with DI, sound and Online, so while VFX was very small you get to work with colourist, a lot of quick vfx shots would spin out of the grade or online where they were too tricky to handle there.\n\n\nWhen working with other depts constant communication is key. That's why you should learn about grading, 3D and FX as well as editorial - you might not be doing it but you need to be able to talk to the people who do.\n\nBigger shots take longer and with more people involved you are more likely to wait for stuff. At Molinare I would pre, roto, matchmove and comp a shot. If there were 3d I would do it so there was no - you need to wait for 3d or need to wait for roto. Having said that 'waiting' doesn't mean not working, it means working on another shot usually.\n\nThe duststorm looks great on my phone g I will watch it on a big screen at home and give you some thoughts!",

        "text": "Hey so that's a very ambitious shot! Nice overall composition and timing. The weakest point is the textures which are a bit low rez and models seem a little low poly especially the steel wall at the start. You can help that in comp by projecting some more detailed images and dir textures. You can used the displace geo give a card more detail and even idistorts can do a wonders. Might be worth playing with.",

I find that quick turnover for advertising quite surprising considering the amount of time and money companies can spend on their campaigns. Have you done much advertising work?\n\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. I've got a pretty good grasp of grading, find FX quite interesting so I just need to invest the time in learning more about it, but I struggle with 3D. I can happily do basic modelling but was certainly glad to leave it behind at the end of my first year. I've still got a good sense of how it works but it's definitely an area I need to pay more attention to while I'm still close to it.\n\nYeah, that's all about what I'd expect. Independent work is good for learning new techniques and testing abilities but I always value the collaboration and fresh perspectives from bigger projects, even if it means spinning more plates and having more fires to put out! How many shots can you end up working on at once and how much can it change between roles and facilities?\n\nThanks so much! Yeah, I get that. We worked in departments for this project; 3D was pretty problematic and there wasn't enough time between them delivering the assets and us delivering the finals. I see! I used cards for a lot of cleanup and effects work in that but hadn't really considered using it on the CG. That's definitely something I'll give a go!\n\nI know my showreel needs to be heavily roto and cleanup focused but I'm curious how it holds up as that bit-of-comp reel shot to you, even if changes would need to be made?\n\nThanks again!",
