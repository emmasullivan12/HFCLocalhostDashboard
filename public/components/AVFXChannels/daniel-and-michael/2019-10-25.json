A senior paint and roto artist from ILM really liked my reel and said it was just the sort of thing they look for from a candidate. I was the only 2D artist up there (and there were only 3 others out of about 60 people, surprisingly) and alongside some really nice 3D artists. Overall it was better than I could’ve thought and the only piece of feedback I really got was to apply for ILM’s graduate programme from ILM themselves. I feel really quite blown away.",
