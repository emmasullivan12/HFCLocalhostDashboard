I think it's very interesting that they assign tech che ks to juniors, at OOU they are done by the Comp Supe so very different (I presume there is a comp supe involved in the process and Dneg probably have a far higher volume of shots coming through).\n\nRather than worrying about the May graduation as they are never going to hire you next week, just base your decision on the strength of your reel and supporting materials.\n\nTry running some tech checks on your own shots such as:\n\nA difference Merge with the plate (should be black everywhere except your comped or graded elements)\n\nA laplacian or similar to check the grain\n\nAlso do a Merge difference between the plate and denoised plate and your comp and a denoised version of your comp. The differences should show you the grain patterns and they should be the same.\n\nViewing the sequence one quarter at a time.\n\nExposure up, exposure down, gamma up, gamma down does anything become apparent? Pump up the saturation, does anything become apparent?\n\nPlay sequence on a loop and a ping pong. Step through sequence frame by frame and toggle between render and plate.\n\nSpend a good half hour on this, in production this will happen after you get creative final on a shot. Somewhere like Molinare or in Advertising with shorter turnarounds you will just do an abbreviated version yourself (5 minutes or so).\n\nNever send a render you haven't watched through, even if you have checked the comp, even if production are crying out for it. It's like feeding your Mogwai after midnight - it'll bring out the gremlins.",

        "text": "I see! I’m aware that most facilities will keep you on record but I figured the right timing would help a bit? It is interesting that they’d use juniors for tech checks! I’ve not heard of it before. I suppose it’s a good way to teach technical standards, makes things run a lot smoother when they’re in a more artistic role. It also definitely gets DNEG a higher throughput of shots rather than relying on a select number of people. It’d free up those senior artists for more complex work rather than what’s comparatively quite objective checks.\n\nGood point. I think I’ve got a strong reel, I’ve been told as much by senior artists before, and I’ve got new professional work I can add. I’ve got good feedback on my CV and interview skills too. Escape’s hosting another mock interview session on Monday and a showreel clinic on Wednesday, both with industry guests, so I’ll get more feedback then.\n\nI didn’t know about the difference merge technique before, but makes a lot of sense. I don’t know what you mean by a laplacian though. The difference merge for grain checking is another great idea. Otherwise, I’ve got into the habit of doing these checks. I just need to go back over what’s in my reel again since I know I wasn’t as thorough back then.\n\nI’ve had a lot of valuable time on the last short film with the supervisor tech checking my shots and other peoples’. He’s also made a point of being really thorough - he’s been generous with his time and very helpful but also clear on the importance of these checks as foundational things. When a supe notices one issue it can cause them to be critical of even more things they might not have otherwise. It happened a couple of times with my edge treatments, one note became three in the new version.",
