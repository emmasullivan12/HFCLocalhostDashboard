Learn enough to know what you’re talking about but don’t lean into it where it’s not needed. Don’t worry about the autocorrect!\n\nI’ve listened to some of Allan McKay’s podcast but wasn’t aware that he had made other content. I’ll have a dig around!\n\nThanks for sharing the list! It’s good to know the really key areas to get right. On the other end, are there any things in your experience that particularly impress or that facilities really look for (obviously beyond a job well done)?\n\nI will do! It was only a few days of work though. I tracked and comped some clouds into seven shots to then be used by the studio to add to the full comp. Three of the shots involved some of roto. Does the fact they’re only assets in a larger comp lower the value significantly? How should I denote that it’s pro work in a reel as opposed to student\/personal work?\n\nThat’s a very good point. That’s why I wanted to look for help to make sure I’m getting the most out of my uni time while I have it.\n\nI’m back to Escape this week! As far as I know we’re working with animation to make our own short films this year so I’m looking forward to getting back. Should be a really interesting and challenging project!",
