On the other hand streaming is going to boom. When quarantine and social distancing measures subside I imagine they are going to want some big tent poles to get people back in cinemas.\n\nOOU was almost empty to day, easy to cycle because almost no traffic. I would really like to stay home but with no work from home option and only one week company sick pay (SSP is a joke) there are not a massive load of options. Obviously will need to cover for lockdown.\n\nTake care, it sounds like you are doing all the right things!",
