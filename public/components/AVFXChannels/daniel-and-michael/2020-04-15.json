If things are slow than Plan B could be your older idea of doing the MA - basically sitting the thing out a bit. Take work though if you can get it!\n\nGreat starting reel a lot better than mine was anyway.\n\nAs well as official job openings I would forward it along to all the people you've been meeting with along the way, from QVFX, visiting tutors etc... In this time of remote working it becomes doubly useful to have met people since they can't arrange to meet with anyone in person now, being a familiar face will give you a bit of an edge.",
