He’s also at uni studying film so he’s at least close enough to the industry to be comfortable there too. There’s another QVFX event at DNEG next week so I’ll be doing more networking there!\n\nI’ve got a good gauge of the people on my course and I’d likely be that go-to person for comp and roto for a fair few people. It’s honestly fascinating just how many people are willing to waste their money here, though. I can’t go a day without thinking about whether or not I’m getting the most out of my time here. It’s an advantage in that it means I’m putting the work in but I wouldn’t miss the added stress, y’know?\n\nI emailed the studio I worked for and they gave me full permission to use the work in my reel and on social media. They also said it was great working with me so hopefully they’ll be in touch again! I’m gonna make a breakdown over the weekend so I can put it online as soon as. I’d love to get your feedback when that’s ready. I’ve also got a new roto shot close to being finished but I’m doing what I can between my current uni work.\n\nAll the best!",
