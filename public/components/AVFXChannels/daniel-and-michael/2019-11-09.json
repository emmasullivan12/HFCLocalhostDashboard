We’re being encouraged to experiment a bit more with Nuke and gizmos and I’m quite technical so I’d like to learn some more.\n\nI’m going to try to speak to the MA’s course leader about it this coming week.\n\nHonestly? I’ve tried to think about it but I’m not entirely sure yet. It makes a lot of sense what my long-term goals would bear on doing the MA though. I certainly like the idea of becoming a supervisor. I’ve found leading the projects I have so far a really fun and engaging challenge and I think I’d work best bringing a director’s vision to life than directing myself. As far as I know, supervising comes with its own set of directing and envisioning itself on a level that I think suits me really well. It’s what I’d say my goal is now but I’d put an asterisk on that for now.\n\nI quite like the idea of doing it part-time and have already considered it. As far as I know, Escape don’t offer it (I’ll ask anyway), and going somewhere else for the MA would add anywhere from £2k-£12k depending where\/what it is.\n\nReading into it, I’ve come across a fair bit of advice to study a masters in computer science or fine art to make yourself more employable. There’s also a fair bit saying to forego it completely. I think I definitely need to prioritise finding out a lot more about the course at this point.",
