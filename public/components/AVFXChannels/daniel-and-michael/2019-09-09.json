It’s my hope to make the most of this academic year to build a professional network and secure work at a studio in London (or Canada if I can) so I can move on to the industry. My peers and tutors alike have complimented me on my creative eye, strong work ethic, and attention to detail. I’m confident I have the skills I need to succeed but I feel I’d really benefit from some help and advice to ensure I’m making the most of my last year at uni and taking the right steps on from there!",
