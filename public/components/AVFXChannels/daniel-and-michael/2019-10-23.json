For Evacuation I would trim the beginning, the door is the weakest element so cut in when it's already moving or even after the door has left frame.\n\nPresenting is fun, let it play, be humble, let them know it's your first reel but don't make excuses or over explain, ask for fedback. Listen to their feedback if they offer any. Big plus is you already have some pro work in there. Treat it more like dailies and have a good time!",

Here it is: <https:\/\/youtu.be\/a-l10UNPnBw>\n\nThat's good advice! I'm quite happy presenting but I do get wrapped up in what people might be thinking. I will absolutely be listening for feedback. I've already been to the past few events and there's always a wonderful family-like atmosphere so I'm looking forward to it. I've struggled to make myself known there so far so I think this will be a big help for me.\n\nI certainly will! Thanks so much for your advice. It's very reassuring.",
