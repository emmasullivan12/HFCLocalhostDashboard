To be fair, knowing what I know now, I could do the shot the same way in a few days, and if I spent the time to learn the tracking properly and utilised keying could probably get fairly close. That’s totally fine, I prefer you being harsh! The industry can be really harsh so I want to be as ready as I can be while I’ve got the time to. Interesting! When did you get your first reel together?\n\nI see! That’s a really good point, I should try to comp it. It’s all well and good telling myself it’ll work out in comp but I’ve got to remind myself that’s my job too! Keying the arms makes a lot of sense. I’ve not done very much keying yet and hadn’t done any when the project started so that’s a key improvement point for me.\n\nEscape, so far, has taught almost nothing about keying, so I don’t have a lot of perspective on it yet. Is it a very common entry-level task to be given and does it vary by facility at all?",
