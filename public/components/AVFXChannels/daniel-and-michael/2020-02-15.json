I can show you the shot I submitted, there are a few things I still need to do to get it up to scratch that I couldn’t do in time for the deadline. Here’s the link: <https:\/\/youtu.be\/VEu6UBqP0QQ|https:\/\/youtu.be\/VEu6UBqP0QQ> I’ve still got to add geometry for the fence on SL, balance the whites on her, and make the offscreen light effect look more realistic. It’d be great to get any feedback from you too!\n\nI’ve also updated my showreel: <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/390189915|https:\/\/vimeo.com\/390189915>\nPassword: LateNateDoubleFeature\n\nI had a new mock interview with ILM’s senior recruiter last week. It went well! I got the feedback from it and I think I made a good impression, there was a good bit of praise and the only improvements were to relax some more and talk slower! I’m 2 for 2 on senior ILM staff recommending I apply when internships open up so hopefully it goes somewhere!!",
