If you're going to stay on I would develop your fine art and creative skills - again your first joplb probably won't use them but stepping up to comp and beyond having strong fine art and photography skills will set you apart. As lo if you're technical a look at Python, machine learning and so on won't go far wrong. \n\nAsk to have a look at the Ma student work before deciding.\n\nWhat's you're long term goal? I don't even mean comp (that's mid-term). VFX Supervisor? Directing your own films? Running a post house? Nothing wrong with thinking big as long as you're not arrogant (\"Next year I wanna be supervising\" because next year you won' t be. But that doesn't mean the big goal is invalid, just that you need to earn your chops. Deciding that goal may help you figure out if the MA is for you and also help with your career choices in future - for example leaving ILM for a start up might be a dumb choice for a Compositor but a super smart choice for someone planning to start their own business. \n\nA third option might be to take the final year part time (it'll take 2 years and you'll need to arrange things with your employers, it'll be tough but probably earn you a lot of respect).",
