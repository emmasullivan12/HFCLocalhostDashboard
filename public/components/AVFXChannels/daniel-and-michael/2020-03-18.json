I’m quite concerned about graduation at this point. My boyfriend’s university cancelled all grad films, so none of the third years know how they’re going to be assessed now. Escape’s handling it well so far though. I have no idea how I’m going to move into the industry at this point though.\n\nHave OOU not taken any measures yet? As far as I’ve seen Jellyfish has taken the lead and moved almost their entire facility remote this quickly. One week doesn’t sound good and SSP is indeed dreadful.\n\nYou too! I’m certainly trying my best\n\nThat’s good! I’ll have to take a look",
