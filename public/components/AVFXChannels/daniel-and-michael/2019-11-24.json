So always keep some personal creative space as it will keep you sane.\n\nMPC Film is notorious and it is no coincidence that the first attempts to unionize happened there. MPC advertising apparently has a much healthier work culture apparently (this is all second hand from other artists). Everyone underbody though that's the problem\n\nI've been working long enough and OOU has prestigious enough projects that I don't feel the benefit of taking a hit, especially when I know the projects would be super tough they offered between 6-14k less annual than OOU so no small potatoes).\n\nCan't wait to see your films!",
