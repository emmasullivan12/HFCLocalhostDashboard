To spread the word about the cause, Kroger and DDB New York turned to Hornet director César Pelizer to create a spot that would be a little different from the bubbly, feel-good anthem and holiday spots, and instead, offer an emotional and symbolic story about unity and inclusion—something sweet and simple, with both clarity and emotional resonance, that would tackle the disturbing fact that one in nine Americans struggle with hunger. With diverse, expressive characters and a subtle narrative about eight people seated around a table offering a ninth seat to a lonely person walking by, César created an inclusive spot with a powerful and uplifting message.\n\nDirector César Pelizer\nAgency DDB New York\nProduction Co Hornet\nExecutive Producer Alex Unick\nHead of Production Sang-Jin Bae\nDevelopment Producer Kristin Labriola\nProducer Lucas Ajemian\nSenior Editor Anita Chao\nAssistant Editor Marianne Hill, Sam Stulin\nEdit Intern Hyeseung Kim\n\nPRE PRODUCTION\nStoryboard Artist Andres Padilla\nDesigners Matt Herring, Milo Targett, Enrique Vazquez\n\nCG\nCG Lead Corey Langelotti\nModeling & Texturing Angeline Rivera, Natalia Perez, Enrique Vazquez, Jamil Primas, Christine Kim\nRigging Jared Eng, Tyler Fotenos\nLighting & Rendering Jamil Primas, Natalia Perez, Christine Kim\nCompositors Jamil Primas, Natalia Perez, Christine Kim, Chimin Yang, Emily Mai\nLighting and Texturing Linda Zhou\nAnimators HeeJIn Kim, Paolo Cogliati, Anderson Ko\n\nAUDIO\nSound Design and Mix Honey Mix\n\nAGENCY\nHead of Account Management Jeff Prince\nAccount Director Jenai Richardson\nAccount Supervisor Madeline McDermott\nAccount Executive Danny Rodriguez\nChief Creative Officer Lisa Topol\nChief Creative Officer Derek Barnes\nGroup Creative Director Katie Jensen\nGroup Creative Director Ani Munoz\nCreative Director Paulo Junger\nHead of Art Cristina Rodriquez\nChief Production Officer David Fisher\nIntegrated Producer Elizabeth Stebner\nSenior Producer Bree Hopenwasser\nProduction Assistant Maya McGauley\nEditor Melina Tenenzapf\n\nCLIENT Kroger",
