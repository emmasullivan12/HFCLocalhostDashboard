        "text": "Hey Linda, I checked out your stuff and it's awesome! I would put your 3D reel on the home page of your website and label it more clearly if you are looking for texture\/lookdev lighting roles. The vis dev stuff is really great too, but the sections of \"artworks\" and \"projects\" are a little confusing. Maybe you could have a \"reel\" section, an \"animation shorts\" section, and a \"visual development\" section? Your reel was great and has an awesome attention to detail. You also have good color sensibility. I don't think it's necessary to include the node graphs of your shaders, since these aren't super complicated. It's good to have wireframes though. This would help reduce the length, since it's a tad long. Try not to go over 90 seconds in length. I also think the cloth sculpting on the second character with the red hair gets a little lumpy. If you know Marvelous Designer, creating the clothes in that software as a base and then sculpting detail in Zbrush might be helpful. Definitely include the Hornet piece on the next cut of your reel, and include a breakdown of what you did like in your personal pieces. I would also recommend including 1 or 2 photorealistic pieces in your reel. Your style is great, and would be a good fit for studios like Blue Sky, Nathan Love, and Buck. But there are even more studios that lean towards photorealistic work. The style of a project also varies greatly, so it is helpful to include a variety of styles in your reel.",
