Your lighting looks great in some of your projects, so I think that would widen the job prospects a lot. As an example the lighters at Framestore also do texture and lookdev but they're not experts at modeling. But if you don't want to be a lighter and go the asset route instead I would recommend being proficient at modeling. But it takes time and you're on a good track! ",
