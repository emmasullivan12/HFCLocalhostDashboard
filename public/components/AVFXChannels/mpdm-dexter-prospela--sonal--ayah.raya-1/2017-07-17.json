I'm planning on going to visit Exeter soon. I think they offer a year abroad, is that correct? Would you recommend that? ",

The second one is further away but at least worth seeing the town and the beaches even if you prefer the main campus in the end.\nIs that with the Erasmus scheme? Definitely go for it! Check whether it's available with either campus and I believe they have loads of partner universities so you'll have a nice range to pick from. I think they do a fee trade thing so tuition is covered by you paying UK fees and then just look into whether you'd still be eligible for a maintenance loan that year. Anywhere in particular you'd like to go for the year abroad?\nAlso we must do your career plan tomorrow! I'd say today but I'm heading to my sister's graduation ",
