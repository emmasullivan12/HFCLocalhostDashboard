In primary school you teach pretty much all subjects, which is one of the reasons why I chose it (I don't think I could just focus on the same ten texts in secondary school, much as I love English). I'll be starting formal training in September which I'm both excited and nervous about! The school I'm training at is really nice though and I'll also be at uni one day a week. I'm going to try and send you some shots of life in teaching next week and feel free to ask me absolutely any questions you want about uni, work etc",
