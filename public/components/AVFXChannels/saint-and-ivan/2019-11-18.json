I have a bit of skills in Composing in After Effects and some 3D design and modelling in Cinema 4D and I've started learning some Zbrush but I want to focus more on Visual Effects. I have thought several times about starting a course (although most I can't afford it) but I would like to start with the basic principles on my own and start playing with the software before.Why do you think it would be better to start? Maybe Houdini?",
