I have 3 assignments across my modules, I'm mainly focusing on my 3D matchmoving module at the moment, which we have to create 3 different shots using the same backplate and camera tracking data. I put all my work up on a 'digital sketchbook' which the tutors use to mark, any feedback on what I've got so far would be very handy!\n\n<https:\/\/ryan02764.wixsite.com\/portfolio\/3d-matchmoving>",
