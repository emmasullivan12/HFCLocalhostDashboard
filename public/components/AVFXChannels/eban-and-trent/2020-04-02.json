        "text": "Hey Eban! Thanks so much in advance for being my EMentor. So to tell you a little about me, I went to SCAD and studied animation and graduated in 2018. Since then I went to an internship at a small studio called Millions of Tiny Robots in Atlanta and became a 3D Generalist doing lots of animation, texturing, modeling, some lighting, and lots of work in Unreal. I loved doing that but I felt like I still wanted to work on film\/tv, so I soon got accepted to the MPC academy where they trained me and taught me the pipeline to finally starting as a full on animator at Mill Film. \n\nIn Montreal i worked on CATS and another vfx project that so far is not announced. Doing vfx in Montreal was so so so fun but I started to kind of miss being in the US and someone I had once worked with briefly in Atlanta had told me about a previs studio he got put as the supervisor at back in Atlanta and offered to have me on the team. So I wanted to jump on that opportunity as soon as I could. Unfortunately plans changed and projects got shifted so as soon as I got down to Atlanta I was left without any leads. I continued my job search, updated my reel quite a bit, almost got back in a few places, and then this whole virus thing hit at the worst time.\n\nSo I think through all of this I’m really just looking for any advice or guidance you may have. I’ll send you my demo reel link if you’d like to take a look as well! For a long time I’ve been trying to think of things to add to it as well but honestly everything going on right now has hit me with a bit of a demoralizing creative slump, so I really will appreciate any and all input you have.",
