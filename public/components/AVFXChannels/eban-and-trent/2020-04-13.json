But it also comes down to how you are connecting to the remote workstations. I've been using HP rgs for the last two weeks and is is fairly good. But it needs to be connection to an HP workstation on the client end apparently, I do not have an HP but there is one in the office that I am connecting to. I had to use team viewer for the previous two weeks and it was not great, but could have been the bandwidth issues in Brooklyn the the time. People there now are having a good amount of connectivity issues.",
