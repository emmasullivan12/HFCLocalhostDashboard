On the second shot, robot in car, the text jumps\/changes of Escape Studios. \n\nAlso using the logo for your school \nLike this (attached) might look more professional. \nReference reels that professional studios create. \n\nI would lose the \"personal project text\" and just leave it blank. \n\nAlso don't really need  the \"responsible for.\" \nFor example \n\"Modeled characters, textured props\" Instead of responsible for modeling penguins &amp; texturing kitchen props \n\nThe text might also look nicer at slightly lower opacity to highlight your work more\n\nWhen you do the wipes it may look better with a line down the middle to distinguish the layers better. And I think the penguin breakdown should show off your textures rather then the compositing. \n\nDont need the solid title that just says \"breakdown.\"  Also the music is kind of unnecessary. Don't need to give anyone a reason not to watch your reel and to want to watch it multiple times. \n\nFor the model breakdowns I would try to either wipe the layer on in one frame or wipe them on as it is rotating so it lines up. When the next layer comes on and the rotation changes it is distracting. \n\nCool work! Are you still finishing school?",
