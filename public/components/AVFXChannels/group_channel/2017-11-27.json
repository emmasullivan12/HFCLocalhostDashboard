In the end, she decided to retake her A-Levels (to get good enough grades to impress employers), then studied the AAT (an accounting qualification) paid for by an employer instead. She saved A LOT OF money from not having to take out student debt, got great first-hand experience of the workplace and actually ended up staying with that employer and is doing very well. \n\nShe had to work very hard to get there though.
