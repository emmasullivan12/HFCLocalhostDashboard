I started in sales, then banking, then in oil &amp; gas, then in education and now technology ... its been pretty varied!!\n\nDexter shared your profile with me and am excited to find out more about you. It seems we're both interested in psychology (I've used it a lot in both my education &amp; tech jobs) so I'm sure we have lots to talk about over this programme (as well as gym and TED talks which I love too!)\n\nIt would be great to hear more about you! What are you currently studying at school? You mention that you're looking to draft a CV, find work experience and build out your extra-curricular activities. I can definitely feedback on your CV and help come up with a strategy for job hunting if you like, plus once I know more about your career goals I can help brainstorm a few extra-curricular things to do to help you get there...\n\nAnyway, enough from me! Let me know what you're hoping to get out of mentoring too. Am excited to be your mentor and help you in any way I can :smile: Available any time you fancy chatting, just drop me a message and I'll try to reply as soon as poss. :ok_hand:",
