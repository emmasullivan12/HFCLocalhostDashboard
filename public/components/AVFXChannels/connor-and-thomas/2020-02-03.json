My name is Tom, I’m currently studying Computer Character Animation at Teesside University and hope to become a modeller within the VFX industry. I’m really hoping to get more of a grounded understanding of what’s expected from graduates on their first position within the industry, how I can stand out from the crowd when developing my showreel as well as some industry insights.\nBest regards,\nTom.",
