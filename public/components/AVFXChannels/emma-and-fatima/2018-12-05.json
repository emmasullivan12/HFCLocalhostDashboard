        "text": "So firstly, really nice job on your first CV @Fatima! Woop! Love the layout and energizing orange colour. :tangerine::tangerine:\n\nLet's think about why we are doing this CV ... to get work experience in a technical role right (correct me if wrong)? So therefore we need to show the side of you that is going to be well suited for such a role i.e. starting to build technical skills, being a keen learner and having a \"well-rounded\" personality e.g. leadership skills, team work etc. And I think you've made a really good go at this. I do have a few comments to help make it even better...\n\nHere are my comments on each section specifically:\n*1) Profile section*\nIf I didn't know you and read this section first it would give me the impression that you are no longer a student and thus I would set the bar much higher for you as a potential recruit. I think this is because you say \"I am a professional customer service rep...\".  It's def good idea to get across your work experience, but this paragraph doesn't actually say who you worked for or when.\nPerhaps you could re-word to say something like \" _I'm currently an A-Level student, passionate about [INSERT INDUSTRY \/ SKILLS HERE RELEVANT TO JOB ROLE YOU WANT TO APPLY FOR]. I'm keen to build on the technical skills that I'm developing as well as my experience as a [part-time?] Customer Service Representative at [COMPANY] where I had my first insight to supporting multi-national clients, and the importance of acting on customer feedback to build loyalty_.\"\n\n*2) Education section*\nThis is great - nice and succinct. It's typical to put the most recent activity first so maybe put A-Level section before the list of GCSE subjects. Also check formatting as there seems to be a gap between the header and where you start typing about Villiers\n\n*3) Technical skills*\nLove the way you show this (I might steal it for my CV haha). Maybe put in order from strongest to weakest skills. Maybe increase Python a little as 1 out of 5 looks quite low and I'm sure you actually know more Python than most adults!!\n\n*4) Volunteering*\nCould you elaborate more on Wings of Hope? What was your role in team? It seemed to me like you were leading the team so why not show off a bit here!!\n\n*5) Achievements*\n- Careful with formatting...Is the colon at the end of \"Student of the year award\" supposed to be there?\n- Why not delete \"Prefect\" as you already say \"Senior Prefect\" and that sounds more prestigious. Will help you save space.\n- Sports leader for what sport exactly? Would be great to mention it as it might interest a potential interviewer and give them something to talk about with you! I would include the basketball organising in this section too.\n- Why not add that you were a Prospela mentee here? Shows you are interested in learning about the industry you are trying to get in to and proactive.\n\n*6) Personality highlights*\nThis is a nice touch as you can start to picture who you are as a person. Rather than just listing out things as bullet points, why not have a small icon for each point e.g. for \"Cheerful disposition\" you could include a smiley face, for \"Motivated by problem solving\" you could have a jigsaw puzzle piece, for \"Works well with deadlines\" you could have a clock etc ... just to show off personality which I think is what you're trying to do here and is a great idea!\n\n*Other comments*\nYou should definitely list your customer service rep work experience in its own section.  Could you move the Wings of Hope volunteering into \"Achievements\" section? and then change that Voluntering header to \"Work Experience\"?\nIt's great that you were obviously trusted enough by your boss to be put in front of real clients already! So show it off here!! And you can even put a spin on it related to the jobs in tech \/ security you want to apply to e.g. saying how you used customer \/ user feedback to offer a product \/ service, having attention to detail etc.",
