A good place to start is probably to see if there are any companies or industries that interest you? We can then see if they offer work experience on their website in their tech\/security team...and if not, it might be worth still applying as you can learn how tech teams work (even if its not specifically in a tech company i.e. it could be Primark's tech team for example!])",
