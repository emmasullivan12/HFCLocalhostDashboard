This is a good age to start thinking about what sort of opportunities are out there when you begin your career in work. \n\nObviously the foremost important part is making sure you take it step by step, I.e. Good GCSEs, Good A levels, good degree and then continually networking (interacting with as many people as you can). \n\nIt's good that you enjoy those subjects, history gives you good grounding and improves your writing style, whereas maths and economics are perfect when applying for jobs in the finance industry when you leave school and university.
