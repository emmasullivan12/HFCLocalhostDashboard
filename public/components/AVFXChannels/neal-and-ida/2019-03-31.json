I love how with VFX we can make whatever we imagine and tell stories without the limits of reality. While I have studied VFX this year I have discovered i don't enjoy doing the technical part and working in the different softwares is not a strength of mine. So i am looking into studying film production instead. But I think learning VFX is such a great way to learn about filmmaking.\n\nDid you know right away where you belong on a VFX team or have you tried different roles to find out?\nWhen working on a film, how is the process of working with the director? And what, in your experience, is most often a challenge when working with people outside that does not know so much about VFX?\n\nThank you so much!\nIda",
