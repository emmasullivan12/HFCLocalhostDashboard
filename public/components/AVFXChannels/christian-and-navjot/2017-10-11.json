Then a call with a lawyer in Dubai to discuss a possible partnership bidding for a large project in Cyprus. That took me to lunch. After a morning talking, the afternoon will be spent reading through documents sent from the Philippines to see if the information needed for our analysis is there. A fairly typical day when projects are in full flow.",

        "text": "I've taken a quick look at your CV. I like that it is concise - it shows that you can summarise things well. Some high level comments: The first thing to remember when writing a CV is that whoever reads it when you apply for a job is probably reading a lot - when I advertised jobs in the recent past we were getting over 50 applicants per role. So the first criteria that will be used are often fairly arbitrary. That means you need to make sure the \"little things\" are covered. You need o carefully proof read to make sure there are no typos etc - for example, there is a missing full stop at the end of the first sentence, and the dates are not consistently written (you use \"SEP.\" as an abbreviation, then use the full \"JUNE\", and later you don't capitalise all of \"February\"). Very small things, but consistency is good. Your personal statement is excellent, short and too the point. You might want to move the paragraph from your \"Hobbies &amp; Interests\" section up to that section, as your paragraph there is an excellent description of why you want to have a particular job - you should rewrite it for every job you use this CV for, so that the person reading it can tell that you have put thought into the role you are applying for. If you move that paragraph, the interest and hobbies section should be used to briefly list the things that you do for fun - I always like to see that a potential employee knows how to live life outside of the office! Finally, two comments on the \"Achievements\" section. The first three words aren't necessary in a CV. The last sentence is a bit out of place - in an interview you may be asked about weaknesses, but it isn't really something for a CV. You could reword it something like: \"This award developed my leadership, teamwork, communication and organisational skills.\" As I said, it's a good CV, well written and very clear, these comments really are minor. Hopefully they make sense!",
