Although it's a version of Maya that we had padded out with tons of proprietary tools that Framestore's R&amp;D team and senior CFX artists had developed. Each department at Framestore has it's own shelf of tools, so it was only possible to learn the workflow from within the company - there are no tutorials online for the work we were doing",
