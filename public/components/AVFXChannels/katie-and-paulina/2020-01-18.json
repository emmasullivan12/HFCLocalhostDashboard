And I'll make sure to contact your friend Roo soon!\n\nI have some great news regarding our team project. We've finally decided on our narrative and are filming very soon - 27th to 29th of January with a professional actor we found (just need to find a female actor for a very small role).:) We just put our rough pre-vis today that we shot yesterday. We're still thinking of changing some shots etc and next week we'll film a proper pre-vis based on a new storyboard that is currently in progress. Really want to make it as professional as we can, so making pre-vis ahead to find out what works and also gathering filming style and grading inspiration.\n\nWhat regards CG, I'm kind of finishing the model, trying to finalise the face as I'm planning to get to facial blendshapes next week which is gonna be a really fun ride for me.:D I'll ask you couple of questions if you don't mind about blendshapes:\n\n1. I read online that you shouldn't make the jaw opening blendshape based. As blendshapes are a linear blending and when you are blendshaping, you are essentially morphing from one position to the other, so basically you end up shearing the polys and that also means that the volume doesn't stay consistent. In this case what is the right thing to do when wanting to have closed mouth to deform to open mouth? \n2. If I have teeth, tongue and gums inside the mouth, how do I make it so it would stick inside, or would I move it manually in ZBrush as I have different mouth movements (as it is separate geo from skin)?\n3. When finally making blendhapes in maya would you need to cut the model (the resting face and the expressions), so it is only monkey's head and neck? And if yes, how do you then attach it to the rest of the body?\nI hope these questions makes sense!\n\nI'm going to include our current script, so you can take a look at it and tell me what you think if you have time!:)\n\nI'll also send my monkey model soon! :monkey:",
