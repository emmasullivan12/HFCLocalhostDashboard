        "text": "Hi Katie!! I'm so sorry to get back to you quite late, it has been pretty stressful and I had some personal problems I had to deal with but everything seems better now! :sunflower:\n\nI hope you're doing well and it's exciting to hear about the upcoming project! :sparkles: If you're ok to answer - why are you thinking to go work in Film again after the end of the current contract? I'm having quite a dilemma lately whether I want to apply to games or film company. I've been mainly focused on film and tried to make pieces oriented to that - realistic creatures but recently found myself really questioning whether I'd like to work there.. Sometimes it seems as it doesn't really have as much creative freedom and seems way more stressful but I guess it really depends in what company you work and what type of work you do... I didn't have experience in neither, so can't tell much about it.\n\nI have a CV that I did recently - I will attach it at the end, so you can take a look! I also created a website - it's still WIP, I'm going to update the reel and works posted there but if you're interested to see it, you can check it here: <https:\/\/www.paulinarybakaite.co.uk\/>\n\nThanks a lot for all the useful information! Will check the links soon.\n\nIt has been quite crazy because of the virus at my university - all the lectures are going to be online until Easter break and after that we don't really have any lectures anyway.. Some students don't have access to powerful enough pc's for software and some don't even have a pc, so it's even worse for them, some even left to their home countries already as the university will probably not open until the end of this semester anyway. Lecturers are trying to get free software for us as not everything has student versions. I'm happy that I can still work at home but it's quite hard to always keep working here but I'm doing what I can. I hope we'll figure out how we're going to render out our film as we don't have arnold licenses for Houdini, but hopefully lecturers will get back to us about it. We're still motivated to finish the short-film - it's really difficult to work remotely but we're not giving up and working as mush as we can. I'm also working on the other projects - deer that I have started a while ago but didn't get a chance to work on properly, fixing the dinosaur which I did in first year and working on DNEG live project. A lot on the plate but hopefully I'll be able to make a decent showreel to apply for internships (if they're not going to get cancelled).\n\nI hope you're staying safe too! :sunny:",
