        "text": "I'm going to write a brief introduction about myself.\nThis year I finished my first year in the University of Hertfordshire on the 3D animation &amp; modelling course. Before coming here I graduated from Justinas Vienozinskis arts school in Vilnius, Lithuania where I’m originally from. It was a four-year course on mostly traditional art (painting, drawing, sculpting, graphic design and graphics being the main subjects). I also graduated from a choir singing school ‘Liepaites’ where I studied for 11 years. And of course high school where I had bunch of different subjects like maths, languages, biology, history etc. I came here originally wanting to do 2D animation (I chose this pathway at the beginning of the first year) but I naturally transitioned to 3D, specifically organic modelling. I haven’t had any 3D experience before coming to the University but I think that I managed to get some solid foundation knowledge in software already (Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, a little bit of Nuke). Recently I’ve been very keen on creature sculpting and anatomy and I believe that that’s what I would like to do as a job. I’m also very interested in rigging and CFX (muscle, skin, fat sim) and planning to take rigging elective in my second year, which I think should be very useful. My current goal is to improve my current skills and build a strong showreel which could get me an internship in the VFX industry at the end of my second year. I really hope that this connection that we’re going to build with you will benefit both of us!:&gt;\nI’m going to share my previous works below.\nWorks that I did in arts school before coming to the uni: <https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/138761672@N03\/>\nModelling works at uni:\n<https:\/\/vimeo.com\/337044306>\n\nOh and my main interests are: sculpting (both traditional and digital), lighting, colour theory, cinematography, anatomy, cooking, singing, drawing, listening to music, travelling. :’D",
