But I thought I’d mention it because it was mainly my passion for creature design\/anatomy that got me in, and it was a really important step for me to get into and experience the VFX industry as a starting point.\nIt also meant I was working with creature characters all of the time instead of inanimate objects\/vehicles\/props which is often what a lot of modelling consists of.",

I’d suggest you also keep your design ideas very close to, if not an exact replica of, real-world examples. So your ideas of the deer\/monkey\/typewriter\/telephone are great because you can potentially do a side-by-side comparison of your reference with your model, to show off how accurate you can be.\nYes, as Amy says; you don’t need to do any texturing if you are applying for a modeller position but they will definitely want to see nice, clean topology and your UV maps.\n\nAmy is a friend of mine from Framestore!\nI’d also recommend you contact my friend Roo, he’s a modeller at Framestore London and is doing a lot for the VFX newcomer community with videos and tutorials etc. <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/roo_vfx\/>\n(Ruairidh MacNeill on Linkedin)",
