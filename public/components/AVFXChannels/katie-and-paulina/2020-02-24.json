Yeah woo it's been a roller coaster year for me so far... but work is coming along well - I think we may be announcing our project in the next few weeks\/months which is exciting!

I have never studied 3D animation so I don’t think I’m best to answer this question, I’m sorry!\nYou can definitely use Zbrush to set up your blendshape geometry though, providing it is all the same polycount - I think that’s a much better option than relying on 3D package sculpting tools.\nI guess you would weight the teeth and gums to the jaw skeleton to keep it all synced up in 3D space - again, this question is probably better suited to animation or rigging people!",
