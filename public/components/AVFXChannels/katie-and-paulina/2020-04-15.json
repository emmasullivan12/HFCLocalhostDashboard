Happy to hear from you :relaxed:\n\nHope you're safe!\n\nFirst of all, thanks a lot on telling me about your experience in film and games and the table, very helpful!! :sparkles:\n\nThanks for looking at the website and CV, still have to improve it a bit. I'm currently working on my showreel, the one on the website is just a placeholder for now, so will definitely include wireframes in a new one. :+1:\n\nNot going to lie, it's pretty tough working remotely sometimes, trying to still be optimistic and talk with people on the phone, so I wouldn't be completely socially isolated. Planning to go home to Lithuania for sometime after this pandemic calms down. :lizard: Also, interested to know how this virus will affect internships.. I know that some places still accept applications, so maybe by the time they start, everything will be as before, hard to predict I suppose...\n\nOur deadline for the project got extended a bit - now it's on 18th of May, so that's good, gives us more hope! :grinning: And thank you for the support, I really appreciate it! I'll share new stuff soon.\n\nI'll now check the website you sent!",
