It is possible at small, boutique places but I wouldn't reccomend it personally. Most compositors at Framestore will have either been a runner or in paint and roto (most will have done both) as they are the entry level jobs to get to comp. I would start practicing your roto and get a really good reel with high level roto and some paint as that is what we look for in applications for paint roto artists. \n\nI took a bit of a different route to most people. I was the first VFX apprentice, there was 5 of us and it is run by NextGen but as you've gone to uni it's a bit late for that but is a great way in. I didn't have to be a runner and went straight to paint roto and quickly developed in to a lead and then on in to comp",
