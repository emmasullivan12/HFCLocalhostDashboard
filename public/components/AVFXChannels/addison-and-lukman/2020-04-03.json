For example if you needed to do a sky replacement would they they give you the image of the sky they want you to replace with the original or do you find them yourself.",

This is more the case at bigger studios, in your example generally DMP (digital matte painting) would create you a sky or find you one from a library to use and you would comp it. Sometimes you can just find them yourself but often they are built specifically for a shot\/sequence. At smaller studios it may be more common to have to find them from libraries yourself as departments are smaller and have less resources",
