I work at Ernst and Young 2 days a week where I am a manager in Banking Capital Markets audit (that didn't make any sense to me either when I started). It basically means I manage teams of people who look at how much money companies (namely banks) have made each year and tell them if we think they're right. I also have started a team of people who are working to build our brand in FinTech (financial technology) so that's pretty cool and I can tell you more about that if it's something your interested in.\n\n2. The rest of the time I run my own business which is an app startup called Tmup. It's basically an app to help you find people to play sports with, find teammates or try new sports. Hopefully will be launching it in a few months!\n\nOh awesome! So what sort of things made you like Portsmouth? One thing I would say is visit as many different universities as you can before you decide, as they are all massively different! Have you got any more open days lined up? ",
