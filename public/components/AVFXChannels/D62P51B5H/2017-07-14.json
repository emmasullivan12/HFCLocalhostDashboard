Also, soon i will need to raise some money to fund further development, and so i am preparing a presentation to present to people who might want to invest (think dragon's den)\nThen when i am at EY (my other job) i am working with a team of people to win some new business\nSo we are trying to understand what they will be looking for and how we can best target out business to help them\nBut enough about me!\nLet's get on with your career plan!\nWould it help if maybe we did it over a call at some point over the next few days on here?\nWe can then talk through the questions and fill it in together\nWhat do you reckon?",
