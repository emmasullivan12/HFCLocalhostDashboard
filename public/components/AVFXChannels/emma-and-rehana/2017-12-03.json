Until then I'm happy to chat and answer any last minute questions you have!\n\nOtherwise I think we've had a great 2 months. Hope I've managed to give you some insights to work that you might not have known otherwise and that it was useful!?\n\nI'll be following you on LinkedIn (if you have an account feel free to add me!) and hopefully on prospela once the user profiles are set up! Cannot wait to see how your career progresses (in Dental Hygiene or otherwise!) - I have high hopes for you! :muscle::ok_hand:",
