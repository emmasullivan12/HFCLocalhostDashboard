This is mostly online, but includes lots of research and distilling what my company does into a crisp, clear, inspiring message to encourage funders to get on board our mission!\n\nAs well as this I’m having discussions with our partner schools about how their programme with us is going (including Villiers!) and a few other meetings in London with potential partners \/ clients. There is a lot of client management required in my role ... lots to keep on top of and clients to keep happy!",
