I produce visualisations for the department based on the content we receive from the architect. We might receive a 3d model we can use or sometimes its just a photoshop file.  \n\nAs the lighting team need support in this area for client presentations, I’ve focused my role within the team to provide visuals for them. As this is my main skill and career path I want to develop in. \n\nWith my portfolio, I’ve focused on developing work in my free time that focuses on 3d and 2d concept art. This is an area I would most like to pursue within the entertainment industry. I’m still developing my site layout, and considering more images that show my work process. Ive included a link below if you want to check it out...\n\n<http:\/\/www.samsaundersdesign.com|www.samsaundersdesign.com>\n\nI’m more than happy to get your feedback. If you see any noticeable gaps or things I should include that I haven’t already - Let me know. \n\nIve been considering the games industry as a possible move. But not ruling out of industries like TV, film, commercials. \n\nSounds like you’re doing well at Framestore. The working coming out of that company is always vey impressive. Did you have a similar job prior your current role or applied after your masters?\n\nSpeak soon. \n\nSam",
