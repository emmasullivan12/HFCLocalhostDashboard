Sorry for the slow replies, busy time of year :grimacing:\n\nThat’s really interesting, when you said lighting department I assumed you meant 3D lighting but do you actually mean lighting installation design kind of thing? (Don’t know what that is called) either way I think your graphics and concept stuff is really really good. You obviously have a good eye and composition skills. I wish I could do lookdev like that!\n\nLet me have a more of an in depth look at your site and see if I can think of any suggestions. Games is really exciting and certainly for compositor\/2d\/lighting work is more creative and I think if that’s where you’re aiming you’re on a really good path with your work already. The key will be in presenting it and showreel\/cv stuff which I can definitely help with. Do you have breakdowns of how you create some of your images?\n\nThis is actually my first job in the vfx industry coming straight out of the National Film and Television school a few years ago. But previous to that I worked on set in tv and commercials as a production and camera assistant and then did some editing and graphics work. But yeah, Framestore is a great company and the work is always high standard whether it’s from film or tv or other departments. ",
