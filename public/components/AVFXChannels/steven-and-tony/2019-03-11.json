Sometimes you need to take some time to refocus yourself, I find listening to music helps me, I'll take one of my favourite albums, sit\/lay somewhere comfy alone, without distraction and just listen to it. When I'm thinking about 100 things at a time it's nice to just channel into something...sometimes if I have the house to myself I'll tidy up and stuff to find some inspiration but that's probably a more odd one! haha Washing the pots with an album on relaxes me quite a lot. The important thing is to try and clear your mind I think! The more I think about all the things I need to do the less ability I have to do them :stuck_out_tongue: Maybe going for a walk or sitting doing some people watching too could help, I only really did that in Spain while my gf was working and I had days to kill, but it was definitely inspiring!",
