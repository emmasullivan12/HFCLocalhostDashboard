Just a brief overview, I have some knowledge of maya and other 3D packages, I have an interest in game design ( as a hobby) and i am currently journeying through Nuke. My main focus is compositing and matte painting but would love to take in any knowledge in any area you would like to offer. ( On my free time i enjoy playing around with Photoshop, studying Japanese and playing a game or two) From what I understand you are on holiday at the moment, I shall let you enjoy and make the most out of it! Looking forward to our E-mentoring experience! All the best\n-Tony",
