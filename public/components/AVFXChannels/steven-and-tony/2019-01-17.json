I never really got into them, their singer cameod on one of my favourite bands latest album though, Every Time I Die :smile: and actually am going to see Mastodon next week! Not sure if you're into the heavier stuff haha Yeah it's always a slow start coming back (more so when you have so much on your plate!), try to take things slowly and focus on the task at hand when you can. That's amazing!! What are your plans for it? I've never published a game. Some of the guys have done a few cool ones though! <http:\/\/www.milo-games.co.uk\/> . How are things going with your uni projects at the moment? I listen to a lot of Spanish music, find that helps a lot! Yeah we speak spanish more and more with the boring conversations like what's for dinner aha. I like the idea of making phrase lists! Yeah I know what you mean, it's so hard to express yourself when you're new to the language, I've got a good vocabulary but actually using the words can be frustrating! I'm on the same series still, we're almost done with it - with some new episodes being released next week actually! <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2bXIPzgsVng&amp;feature=youtu.be> we've had some pretty fun episodes coming through lately! And had great chances to play around with MASH for Maya - more of a motion graphics tool but can be used for crowds and all sorts, I love it haha I'm planning to do a little Easter project in Blender to learn it - but not sure if I'll find the time, maybe will stick to Maya for now!",
