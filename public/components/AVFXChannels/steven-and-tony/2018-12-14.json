I think maybe now it's a little too blue in the highlights, and maybe too dull overall. The wall has a fair amount more red than your unit, you could maybe soften the shadow a little too - the shadow angle is making it look like its farther away from the wall than it appears? You could also go the other way and pull the reds down, and blues up in the plate if you wanted a more overcast gloomy look!",

I will try and practise some rigging and animating because i am out of touch with 3D. The final comp ended up looking nice afterall! I did some post production in after effects :relaxed: cc rain, vignette, grain it looks a bit more stylised  not sure if it’s better or worse, i will try and get you a link for the actual clip when i get the chance after waking up !
