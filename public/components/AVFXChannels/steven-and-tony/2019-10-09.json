I'm focusing more on composition really at the moment, grading and balance. I really need to update my showreel but finding the time is near impossible, that's something that never stops hah!",

I tried picking up character animation during my final year and wasted a lot of time with that, as it was just what we were told was the 'best' thing to be doing in uni...if I look back, my work was always about trying to make a pretty finished product, so in hindsight I would have been better focusing on finding group work and being the post guy. It's fine not to have a single focus right now in my opinion, if your focus is on picking up new skills and finding where it is you enjoy most, the rest will shape itself around that! It took me two years out of uni of doing voluntary projects on the side, with some rough personal life times as well, until I landed my first paid job in 3D, as a render wrangler, and all of the skills I'd picked up from dabbling around in my own time really paid off and kept me hired as a junior generalist!",

Had to collect my glasses today, first time I've had to wear them haha went to visit Romania for our anniversary too that was incredible! Work wise I've mostly been getting on with Paddington, we're all a little behind at the moment so it's quite intense.
