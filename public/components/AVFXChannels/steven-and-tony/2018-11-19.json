A little overview of myself; I come from a generalist background, and have been working with Maya since I began in 3D - on a games design course! Nuke is more recent to me, as I learnt mostly in After Effects. My first role was as a generalist for a small company called Polar Media - working within the technology, and oil and gas industries, so included a lot of varied jobs, and I picked up a heap of skills there! I've been at Blue Zoo since 2016, and have worked on Go Jetters, and Numberblocks (and a couple of the Christmas shorts too!). Here I use Maya, Nuke, and occasionally After effects and Photoshop. I don't have very much knowledge of matte painting - we had an artist on Go Jetters that did them for the backgrounds. As far as I know it's a very employable skill to have! Here at Blue Zoo, and in some other studios for TV series production, lighting and compositing have become single artist roles, which makes sense for us as they go hand in hand really! I'm also new to slack, now that I'm back I'll get it running on my phone as well haha! Hobbies and interest wise I like motion graphics, games of course, and sports (to watch, the older I get) :smile: Do you have an idea of the sort of industry you'd like to be a part of professionally? Personally I love working in kids TV, and would also love to work on full CG movies someday.",
