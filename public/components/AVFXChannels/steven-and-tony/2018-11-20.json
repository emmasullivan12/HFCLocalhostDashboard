I have released a small game online and do like to go in and out of game design periodically! I would like to work in CG movies ideally but for now anywhere that pays :joy: to be honest i have been  a huge fan of photoshop and after effects but now i have gradually transitioned into nuke which is also something new for me, currently working on a CG shot for one of my submissions and as of yesterday the character designer for another project decided to leave and I as the animator of the group will probably do the characters, rig and animate them... while working 5 days a week :sweat_smile: the main reason i signed up for the mentorship programme is because I believe it will keep me motivated. My worst aspect is finding the motivation , usually i work fairly quick despite not being good at most areas :sweat_smile:i will try and find some of my work before i start work (15:00-22:00)",
