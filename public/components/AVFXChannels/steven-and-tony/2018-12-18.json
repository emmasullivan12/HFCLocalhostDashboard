That's a lot of different alphabets, right xD I've been trying to learn Spanish for about 4 years now, since meeting my girlfriend, and that's difficult enough for me haha Okay cool, sounds like a good plan, less is always more with reels, I've actually had my first experience of interviewing\/hiring on this project - it's quite eye opening! We looked over their linkedin profiles \/cvs skimming for the skills\/software we want &amp; went straight for the reel - the ones that credited what they did on the project on the reel itself rather than in the text\/separate breakdown\/not at all grabbed much more attention for me personally. What's making you want to pull away from 3D? Seems to me like you have really strong skills in it. That's great about the game dev! You definitely should keep at it! Even if you go into VFX anything you learn from games dev can easily be applied and will give you an edge for sure. Plus it's always good to keep up skills that make you happy - I wish I'd have held on closer to music, and hope to pick it back up again next year :slightly_smiling_face: Our latest christmas short at the studio was rendered and comped in unreal engine in real time, animated etc in maya - so it's a really good time to have knowledge of games dev!",
