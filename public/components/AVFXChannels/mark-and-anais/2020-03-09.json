My biggest passion is Film, but that seemed like an unrealistic long shot in Spain, so decided to study Media and Communications, with the hope to have a back up not too far away from film. Slowly I started to go into Postproduction, I specialised my studios in Edition, Animation, and I landed an internship in a VR company in London almost 7 years ago. After that, I started as a 'Video Producer' for the same company. As I wasn't too happy with what I was doing, a did an MA in Visual Effects Production (Compositing),  hoping to go into the VFX industry. I worked briefly as a Compositor and I got offered a job at Foundry. At that point I already had work in different Productions as an Editor, Compositor, and in the Art Department.",

I really enjoyed my time in that product, as I was able to help Projects, some for Netflix, Amazon Prime or BBC. Basically, I was guiding the customers through the softwares, helping with any issues they may had with the platform that may affect their productivity or deadline, and suggest changes to the Dev team about the platform\/software; sometimes this changes needed to be effective right away.",
