        "text": "good question. in production we always looked in studio environment. We have a standardised HDRI as well as a 3 point lighting light rig : 2 rectangular silks and a small spotlight. The silks are on each side of the objet, the spot is used as a rim. We also modelled a studio, with ground, curtain, painted wooden turntable, stands with grey and diffuse ball, stand with macbeth chart, and actually studio lights. We realised that client approval rates went right up when we showed assets in a realistic environment. Scale is very important to sell your lookdev. Some clients can't see in an abstract way, and even for us it helps to have a consistent studio environment as well as a realistic scale to compare the object to.",
