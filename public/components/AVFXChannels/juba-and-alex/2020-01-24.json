And no worries take your time, I will start getting busier and busier as well :smiley:\nI really enjoyed working as a remote animator, but it took a toll long term, for me at least. I tend to strive when surrounded by creative people, and when you're home by yourself it created this bubble that drained my creativity and drive.\nI'm sure there's a balance somewhere in the world :smiley:\nAnd you short sounds fun! Bear with me, I'm gonna bombard you with questions! How's are you finding the process of making it? Is it a solo or team project? Are you having to make the rigs or use existing ones? Where are you at in production?\nAnd I took a quick gander at your shot, it's looking good! Will try to spare some time on the weekend for some proper notes :smiley:",
