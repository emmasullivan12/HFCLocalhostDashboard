I don't mind sharing, but keep in mind it's real rough :sweat_smile:\n<https:\/\/vimeo.com\/jubapolati\/cursed>\n\nThat's great news about the desk! And no worries about the project, feel free to share when you have something :smiley:\nSo how is your time split up in the course? Are you mostly focusing on you final project or still having a lot of side classes?\nAlso, how's the warthog anim progressing?",

                "text": "This is my final Animation project from Vancouver Film School, Cursed. It is a film that plays around within the 3D program Maya. It shows an animator and his cursor opening an existing scene with a character named Johnny, an overly confident rig that only wants to relax. But, the cursor wants things his own way, and soon a conflict arises between them.\n\nIt was incredibly fun and rewarding to make, so I hope you enjoy!\n\nI'd like to give special thanks to my family for giving me all the support I needed, you guys are the best!\n\nThank you so much!\n\nFinalist at CG Student awards! And earned a Slayer badge yeeeah!\n\n\nCreated by Juba Polati",
