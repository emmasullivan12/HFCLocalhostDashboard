But its a pleasure to meet you too :smiley:\nI started off working as a freelancer for a few companies, none noteworthy but eventually I landed a remote animator job at Lunar Animation, and worked there for almost 2 years before Framestore contacted me about this job. It was a great experience all round, ended up learning tons and still am. Still have a long way to go!\nHow are you finding the course and everything? Do you have a final project\/ animation?\nAlso if you need just general animation feedback, feel free to send it over. I really like using sync sketch - <https:\/\/syncsketch.com\/>, but I'm happy to help in whatever way's best for you.",
