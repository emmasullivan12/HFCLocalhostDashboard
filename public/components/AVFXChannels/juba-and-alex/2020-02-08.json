Must've been a great test being your own boss and all throughout the project :O\nI'm super curious to see what your FMP was like - I hope you dont mind but could I see it?\nYeah it's been great to have a team that can riff off of each other for ideas, and because we're all freelancing on shots for other projects it feels good when we can all come back to work on our project.\nI'd love to share it with you sometime as well! We're waiting on a finalised rig at the moment so I'm not able to show any animation for it yet unfortunately (soon to come!)\nI was able to speak to my lecturers this week and luckily they've given me permission to use any of the standing lecturer desks granted if theres isn't a class going on in there, which is a relief!\nHope you're having a great weekend :D",
