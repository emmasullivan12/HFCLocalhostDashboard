I'm currently working with three other animators, and we're using UE4 to render our film - I was able to gain some knowledge of the pipeline back during my second year games project which was fortunate :D\nWe have some freelancers helping out with the project as well, with one modelling the burger, the other modelling the spy and the last being our rigger for both our spy and burger (specifically making bun decorations\/squash when the spy holds it)\nAt this point we're at the final stages for both models, our freelancer for the spy is making some final tweaks and then it'll be off to our rigger, in the meantime my main group have been making adjustments to the environment\/props - am very keen to start animating now as modelling isn't one of my fort√®s haha\nI'm curious to know how did you find creating your final year project? Were you also in a team or was it solo?",
