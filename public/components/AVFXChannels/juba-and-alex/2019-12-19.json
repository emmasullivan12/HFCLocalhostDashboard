I'm doing great thanks, how about yourself?\nAhh that's awesome to hear, Framestore seems like such a cool company to work for - I visited a month or so ago and I've been pumped to go back ever since! I'm curious to know what life is like on the other side in industry :grin:\nCurrently I'm studying for my final year at The Unversity if Hertfordshire on the 3D animation pathway, and whilst I love making stylised animation I'm trying to push my realistic\/VFX skills further too :grinning: If you dont mind me asking what other companies did you go to before you applied to framestore?",
