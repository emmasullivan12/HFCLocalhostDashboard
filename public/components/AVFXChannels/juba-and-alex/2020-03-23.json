If you're looking for feedback, the biggest thing to me is that it wasn't clear what the characters objective was from the start.\nThe establishing shot shows the grate alone, and doesn't give us an idea of what the film is about, and you cut to a very similar shot and seems unnecessary. I think you if you show the kitchen with the burger in the foreground, and you do a rack focus from the burger to the grate starting to open, then you cut in closer to the character jumping out it could work better. As an alternative you can have the opening shot, the character struggling in the air duct, brings his hologram out only to look off screen, and then you establish the kitchen and burger. There's many way's you could do it, but this is the stage to play around in layout figure things out =)",
