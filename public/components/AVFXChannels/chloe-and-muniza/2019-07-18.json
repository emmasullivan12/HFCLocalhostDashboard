I hear you with having too many ideas! \n\nMy case is still quite unique because I’ve been in the same company for 3 years. If I were to have been hopping around I think it would have taken a little longer possibly. Also I do work extremely hard so I can get better and go further. So 5 years sounds about average. Working as a senior is very different to being a junior yes. Mostly in terms of what shots I get assigned. I’ll get harder shots and a longer allocation of them. My working hours are the same, though again I am lucky that my company don’t encourage overtime. Personally, I have so many things that I like doing outside of work that I would much rather be doing. Do you have any passions outside of animtion that let you switch off and stay grounded? ",
