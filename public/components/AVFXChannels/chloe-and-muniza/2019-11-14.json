I would only say to make sure that your title card doesn't last too long at the start of your show reel and I would advise to do something very simple. I wouldn't animate it, a lot of people tend to do that and most of the time it does a diservice to their skills because they think it'll make their show real pop. But most of the time it's not great. Clear, simple and well executed is the way to go. Always :slightly_smiling_face:",
