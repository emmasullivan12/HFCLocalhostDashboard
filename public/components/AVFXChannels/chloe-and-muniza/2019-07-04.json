I enjoy drawing and reading comics so I could centre an animation piece around that. I also enjoy baking, karaoke and musical theatre! There's actually a lot of different scenarios I could do with these hobbies :smile: thank you for the suggestion! I will let you know once I start planning a short piece centered around one of these hobbies",
