The dialogue works well to create an anticipation before an exagerrated reaction to the object\/thing the character is reacting to. In the original footage, the speaker is playing a game but I was hoping to have the object be something like a baby or dead animal\/game aha :sweat_smile::joy:",

One of my uni housemates usually goes for a run in the evenings and my other house mate would go to yoga club at university. I realised I havnt fully looked into the different sports clubs and societies at my university so I think I a good starting point would be to research those as they. I think signing up to some of those classes would keep me motivated too aha.",

I think at university, they talk to us about all the larger, more well known studios and that they all tend to be in London so it becomes easy to forget that not all work is in London aha",
