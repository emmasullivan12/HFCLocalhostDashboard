That reminds - the 11 Second club seems really good for acting\/lip syncing practice too so I'm definitly interested in participating in either this months competition or next months one. I tend to have too many ideas at once so I'm trying harder to focus on one project and complete it first before moving on to the next :sweat_smile:\n\nAlso, wow! :open_mouth: Just 3 years?! That's really good! I was always under the impression that studios expected 5 or more years worth of experience before they would consider animators for a senior position but I now understand that it varies depending on the studio and directors. Does it feel different working as a senior animator compared to a junior animator? And have your working hours changed after becoming a senior animator?",
