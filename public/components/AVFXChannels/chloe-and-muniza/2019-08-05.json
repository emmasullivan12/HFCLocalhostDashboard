What were you planning on doing for it?\nWhat kind of sport would you like to get into? I fully recommend doing exercise, I do a lot of cycling, running and boxing. Occasionally, triathlon too and it all keeps me sain and healthy both physically and mentally. I much prefer more cartoon type animation that VFX personally. But whatever you choose, don't forget that there isn't just London :wink: and there are still plenty of places here like Blue Zoo that do beautiful character animation.",
