My name is Klaudia, I'm a 3rd year VFX and MG student at University of South Wales and I'm really excited about this program. \nEven tho I should already know what I want to do in the future (or at least in the next few years) I still can't decide if I'd rather stick to motion graphics or if I want to get more into 3D (always loved animation and would love to try it even tho I've done quite a lot of 2D one for my MG projects). Currently I am working on a design competition brief (we can choose briefs online or treat it as an open one) which I really want to do in houdini. \nSorry for taking so much time to start the conversation, been quite busy since Friday because of work and Uni :disappointed_relieved:",
