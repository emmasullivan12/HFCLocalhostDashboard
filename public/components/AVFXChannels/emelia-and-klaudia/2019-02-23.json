Bet you have some less stressful projects\/deadlines now than the ones back in December (at least I hope so!). Would love to know how your typical working day looks like.\nYes, I am due to graduate soon - in a few months now actually - done my final major project pitch already and started doing some tests for it (not really good ones yet as I've been working quite a lot, but I want to finish everything before FMX). The plan is to do the whole project in Houdini (which I am still learning :sweat_smile:) and Nuke but we will see how it turns out.",
