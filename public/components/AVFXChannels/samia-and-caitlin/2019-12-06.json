In regards to your last message, unfortunately I can’t create an active Linkedin profile until i’m 16. I’m definitely interested into the creative company and would love to reflect that in my CV.  I would also like to start looking to see what i’m most interested in to do with my work experience and apprenticeship even if it’s a little early to look. Thank you for sending me the podcast it will definitely help me with some questions i may have. Once listened to i will definitely love to ask you some questions.",
