My Mum has told me about the Next Gen apprenticeship as it came up on twitter as she follows them and Access VFX - I will make sure to follow them as well to keep myself updated. The apprenticeship looks amazing but unfortunately I have another year of education In senior school. So I will look at applying next year, if I decide that I would prefer this over a HR role.",

I don’t know if that’s an option where you live but when I was 14, in my school program, we had to do a minimum of 40h per year volunteering with organizations. I found it great to have that on my CV when I started to apply at part time jobs at 15 and later to build my experience. I volunteered in a spring break camp with children. ",
