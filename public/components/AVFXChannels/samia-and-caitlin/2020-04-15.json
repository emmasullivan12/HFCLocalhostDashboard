Let’s hope that this will help the world see women have equal value. \nI saw Karen’s response! Very exciting indeed. A first observation day would be great for you to learn more about all the jobs. We’re launching a website next week made for students, I’ll make sure to share it with you once it’s online. \nNew York and Toronto! That’s quite close to Montreal. I enjoy both these cities, they’re full of things to do. New York is very impressive, it’s enormous and your neck aches from looking at the top of buildings too much. It’s amazing. \nI was supposed to visit my dad who lives in the South of France and go to Spain for my mom’s 60th birthday. She had planned a full month there, she’s pretty bummed. \nHow are you passing time? If you decide to learn French let me know. If VFX remains in Montreal for a long time, it’s quite good to speak both here. And knowing more than one language is always an advantage anyway :) \nI’ve started a computer science class on Harvard’s website. They offer a bunch of free courses. If you’re more feeling like not getting into all of this and fine too. We’re living weird times and all coping with it differently. ",
