I've been working on animated features and VFX for just under 10 years now. I started at Animal Logic working on Happy Feet, the Lego Movies and Peter Rabbit before moving into VFX. My history is in animation, both as an animator and in animation assets pipeline, and now my focus is on creature and creaturefx work, so I like to try and work in a way that recognises and enhances the work done by animation which has been really satisfying.  I've been at DNEG for a little over 2 years now and really enjoying that. I'm more than happy to help with your current work, reel, questions about the industry, pay, advice, anything! Happy to help any way I can :)",

Previous to this I studied Visual Effects extended diploma at BTEC level which was also at Confetti. I'm in my second year of my university course where we were introduced to the Creature Design - this is my favourite module and I would like to improve these skills so that I can be better prepared for the role as a Creature Artist. We are also being taught how to use Houdini - I'm currently making a grass simulation using Vellum for my Houdini module, but I want to expand my knowledge of Houdini so that I can create professional looking hair\/fur simulations, but I also want to experiment with muscle simulations and incorporating them with my future creatures.\n\nI'm currently making a full creature for my university module and I'm at the retopology phase which I'm doing manually inside of Maya 2020. I want this creature to potentially be on my showreel so at some point would I be able to send you previews or add your email as a collaborator on FTrack? I completely understand it you dont want to that so I'm happy to create a GoogleDrive folder instead. \n\nI also have another question. What's it like working at DNEG? I want to work for a company such as this but I'm not sure which one would be best? What's it like day-to-day?",

You don't want to go -too- high with your topology as it will slow down your sims but because you want a good representation of your body for good collisions and hair growth, you can afford to go a bit higher and sim time isnt sacrificed too much. What's nice is that you can keep multiple levels of topology of your meshes for faster sims. So for shots that are in the background and the creature is small, you could use a very light mesh for a quick sim, and for close ups you can use the high res geometry for your best sim that's the heaviest to calculate. But if you're after one mesh to rule them all, your instincts are correct and just go a level or 2 higher",
