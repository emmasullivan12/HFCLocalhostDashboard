I also find it easy to go through the financial accounts of a company as I did in some accounting modules. \nAbout IB, I enjoy mainly M&amp;A, because I like how you can value a company through its accounts and S&amp;T, because I like how trading works and I am getting myself a trading account soon. \nEY is such a prestigious firm. I applied last year but got rejected after my telephone interview. I hope this year goes better. By the way, what's your LinkedIn account? I would benefit having you as a connection. Thanks",
