Somehow when I import your file into harmony I can't see the character (I've checked and the drawings are exposed so I don't understand why) \nMaybe it's because I can't see the character that I don't know what O,L and C stands for (I guess it's just where the pivot points are? ) And regarding the cutter, could I ask what is your thought process on decing what needs a cutter? Thank you so much:sunflower: I'm learning so much with this",
