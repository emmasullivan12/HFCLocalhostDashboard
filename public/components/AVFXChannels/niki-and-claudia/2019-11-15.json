I currently work as a 2D Harmony rigger in Blue-Zoo on their first 2D show. It's going so great! The show is looking amazing. It's going to be out on Nickelodeon in January sometime. Before that I was working in Dublin for Boulder Media, and multiple other studios there before that.\n\nI was told that you are interested in 2D animation as well? I would love to help you on your journey, so what do you need? Are you a hobbyist at the moment or studying animation? I'd love to hear more about you.\n\nChat soon,\nNiki",
