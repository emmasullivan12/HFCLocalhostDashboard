And thank you for the extensive reply as well!\nEventhough I finished my animation on Monday, I do want to improve some little things I couldn't improve before the deadline. Luckily through that project I've become more or less comfortable with the drawing tools :) (I followed that tutorial last month), I will start using more pencil though as I understand it's a lot easier to modify the shapes etc. \n\nLuckily now I'm free to learn as much a possible and be very active here. If it's alright, I can get a few modules done and send my work to you by next Wednesday.\n\nI will make the improvements and update my portfolio with it by next Monday so I'll send you the link as soon as I have it updated. I'm very excited to show it and hopefully get feedback so I can improve my next projects :sunflower:. \n\nI have seen your work and I really love it I can't wait to see the updated version.\n\nAgain thank you very much for all your time honestly it's very helpful:)",
