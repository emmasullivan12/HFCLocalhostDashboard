I might be on my period but I actually cried watching it haha. \nThe link to my portfolio is <http:\/\/www.claudiaeiroa.myportfolio.com|www.claudiaeiroa.myportfolio.com>. There you'll find my last animation 'two years of culture', lyses ( from last year) and an animated comic.\n\nAs my portfolio is not very targeted now I do want to change it to only 2d animation and visual development. You'll also find my CV there but I can send it to you :) I will appreciate feedback on anything especially the animations. (I'm not too precious and I have to improve so it helps me a lot:sunflower:)\n\nRegarding the character I'm finishing one today and I'll send it to you :)",
