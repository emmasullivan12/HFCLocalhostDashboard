Hope your project went well for you :slightly_smiling_face: Personally I found that college deadlines were harder to meet well than industry ones, for the most part! Wednesday sounds good to me! Obviously no stress if life gets in the way - December is a busy month! Just keep in touch so I know how you're getting on :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nGlad that you know the drawing tools well. That's so essential. Do you have a simple character design (old or new) that you would like to work towards rigging? If you do, could you send it to me? Otherwise I'll find something simple for us to work towards - some established character or something.\n\nKeep an eye out today, we're releasing the Blue-Zoo Xmas short at 1pm and it looks sooooo good! I'm so excited to have been able to work on it!\n\nAlso, please feel free to throw out any questions you have at any time! I'm happy to answer any you might have. \n\nChat soon,\nNiki",
