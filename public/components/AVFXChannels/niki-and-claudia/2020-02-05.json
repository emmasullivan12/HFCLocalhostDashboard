I didn't get an email update saying you had messaged but like you I've been meaning to get in  touch with you to see how your doing! \nSo my apologies too for not getting in contact before now.\n\nMy advice for your movie would definitely be less is more! So cut out absolutely everything you don't need so you can focus on animating what you do need as well as you can. Time is always tight on student films. I think I still have PTSD from when I did mine. Think mine was one and half minutes in the end. And getting it done nearly killed me!! So be kind to yourself!\n\nI will look at your work over the weekend and get you some feedback :slightly_smiling_face: really excited to take a look",
