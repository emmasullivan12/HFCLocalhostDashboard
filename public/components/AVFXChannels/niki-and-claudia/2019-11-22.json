I'll start with the 3 modules of rigging (in my uni we have ToonBoom). I will check the course when I have the basics down I think:) I will also research into the styles of rigging and curve, bone and envelope deformers as soon as I'm comfortable with basic rigging.  \nIt's very nice to see people determined to work in animation as teenagers and I definitely agree Klaus' animation is so gorgeous I can't wrap my head around it. \nI love different styles but projects like Klaus, the Swallows of Kaboul, Les triplettes de Belleville, Your name, the style of Gris the game... All of them are too good :sweat_smile:\n\nRegarding my portfolio, I am finishing a project in 10 days so I'll update it almost completely and I'll pass it to you as soon as that happens! \n\n(Thank you and I'll be really happy to complete rigging tasks)\n:sunflower:",
