I loved your showreel and it has definitely inspired me to improve my showreel and have better and more suited works in it. For my FMP my animation will contain a few walking cycles of different characters, characters using props and conversations on screen. I decided to do a short film about a group of scientists trying to find the cure of 'An abnormal menstrual cycle'. I really hope you had your well deserved time with your family and friends. During Christmas, I rigged several characters and tried animated them. I am struggling to keep them with weight and in the floor line. I will attach the waking cycle I did for one of the characters",
