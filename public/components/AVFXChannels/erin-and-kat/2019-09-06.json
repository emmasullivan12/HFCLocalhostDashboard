And yep, it's currently sitting on my shelf along with some other compositing and film books. I've spent quite a bit of time with Steve Wright, lol! I'll have to revisit this book though, thanks for the pointer.\nThanks for the encouragement! I'll have to go deep-diving in Pexels, lots of good HD footage there. I'm realizing more that I need to refocus on retargeting for the kind of work three is around here as a junior comp artist. And thanks, no rush! Not many people have taken the time to dissect my reel at all, so any feedback is very appreciated.",
