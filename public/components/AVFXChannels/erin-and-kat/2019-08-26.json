That's way too cool, and exactly the kind of thing I want to work towards way down the line. \nBut a little about me! I'm a compositor who just graduated from SCAD's VFX program earlier this year, and trying to get started in Chicago. As much as I love narrative work, I like the small team\/fast pace of ads, which is why I'm here. \nHonestly as far as mentorship goes, I'm just always seeking out advice on both my actual work and on building my career. I would love to know more about your story! Why you do what you do, what you enjoy about it, what you would have done differently.",
