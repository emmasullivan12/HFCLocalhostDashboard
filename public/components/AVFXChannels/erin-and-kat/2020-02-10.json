It's not paid work, but honestly, the schedule is so lax and the learning is so valuable that I don't mind. I've done 3 or 4 screen replacements, patched out a wedding ring on a guy's finger, stitched a few takes of the same shot together, and currently working on a batch of set extensions. Lots of keying!!",

I had seen one of my classmate's reels where she included a quick example of her roto work on a clip of a skateboarder- is that something companies like to see on reels, or is that too amateur looking? I'm really trying to build a reel that caters to the advertising scene here in Chicago, which seems like a good deal of roto\/cleanup, beauty, and some 3d integration work.",
