Then I participated at the realization of the 2d animated short \"Yujo\", discovering here compositing. \nHere the work I did during that experience, if you'd like to see it: <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/330231750>\nAnd thanks to it I got a job at Blue-Zoo Animation Studio as 2D Harmony compositor.\n\nAnd now why I joined prospela and what I would like to get out of this mentorship:\nI would like to grow in my compositing skill, to work not only in 2D animation, but also in 3D animation and Visual effects. But to get there, I need to learn After Effects and Nuke. And while it won't be a problem study by myself this two programs, I don't really know what are the right steps to do so in an efficient way, without loosing myself in hundreds of online tutorials never getting to the point (or the level) of want the industry truly requires. \n\nWith this mentorship I'm therefore hoping to find some sort of guidance in carving my path, learning all kind of useful things along the way, compositing related and not.\n\nand with this I guess... here I am? \n\nso, thank you again to be willing to start this mentorship, \n\nall the best, \n\nTania",
