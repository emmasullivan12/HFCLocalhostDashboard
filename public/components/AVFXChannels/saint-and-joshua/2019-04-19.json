Essentially moving to Film means showing a level of detail that you dont need so much in Broadcast (generally). Do you have shots that for instance, attempt to be photoreal? More to the point do you have examples of 'physics' based animation rather than 'sqush and stretch'\/exaggeration? Moves where you mimic reality?",
