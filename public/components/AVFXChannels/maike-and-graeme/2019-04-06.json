I would probably asses the amount of time that I have to achieve an animation and how complex and refined it will have to be. \n\nI personally found it helpful to have a pose to pose approach whilst keying all controls at the same point in time. When doing this I try to make sure that I have moved every control in the process somehow to keep my animation organic, so that poses are not exactly the same (unless I want something to hold) . That way I can keep the animation alive and find it less likely to run into interpolation issues. After being happy with the story beats and still having time I will go on to delete unnecessary keys and add offsets for refining. \n\nKeep the poses clean and simple for as long as you can and try to use a minimum of keys to tell the story before you start the polishing. Otherwise it will be a lot to keep track of.\n\nOverall I would suggest trying all different a approaches and see what works best for you, it is art after all and everyone develops their own techniques :)\n\nOh and I get a lot of feedback during the early stages of the aim, it's super helpful to not be too precious about it and see what works before going for 'perfection'.\n\nSo keep up the good work and practice practice practice!\n\nBest regards,\nMaike",
