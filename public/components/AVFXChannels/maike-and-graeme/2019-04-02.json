Its really nice to hear some useful information from someone in the industry it will help me a lot, I was wondering if you do a lot of character animation yourself?\n\nI would love to have some best practice tips from yourself if possible, for example what is the best way to go about keying the characters? Do you key the traditional pose to pose way with extremes then in-between breakdowns?  Or more of a straight ahead approach where you kind of key every movement as you go kind of like stop motion? Do you use keyframe sets and key all the characters face controls in one and then key all the characters body in one?. Thanks so much for the help :slightly_smiling_face:",
