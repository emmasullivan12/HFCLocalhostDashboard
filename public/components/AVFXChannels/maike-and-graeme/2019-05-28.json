I hope to have some time to review your link this week and will get back to you as soon as I can :)\n\nMy biggest tip for your applications would be - and I can not stress this enough - not to \"just try and land a job\", you want to research the companies you apply for and make sure your reel fits the needs that they are recruiting for. Otherwise you will spend 6months or more just not getting a reply at all. \nA company gets so many applications and lots of them are not specified to the companies needs, so they get immediately filtered out. Also keep in mind that there is going to be an interview in which they will most likely ask you why you want to work for them and not just anyone else. \n\nIf you are considering to apply for a specific job I will be happy to have a look and help with writing an application if needed. \nOverall it is though to go straight from Uni into a job, most of the time it is more likely that an internship or being a runner is a good first step into the industry. \n\nAs always if you have any more questions just ping me a message. \n\nBest regards, \nMaike",
