I had a quick look and the first thing I'll say is to put the last shot in the beginning! I think it's the best one and the first rule in showreels is to put your best work in the first 10 seconds.\nI want to have a proper look at it in my desktop and not phone so will do that later on. You should of course add a piece of your final project in, maybe the part where you fall in the hole, no need for the full thing in the reel. Do you have any green screens or roto at all? You want to apply for a junior comp (roto\/prep at the beginning) or cg? \nVery good job! You definitely have a talent and know what you're doing.",
