That's really great feedback thank you, I've got about a month left before my deadline so I'll will definitely be adding too it and making the changes you have suggested. Hopefully I can find a nuke solution to breaking up the edges as I've lost access to the renderfarm now the uni has shut! \n\nI was slightly worried about the colours of the digidouble, do you think it is matching well enough? \n\nI've got a little showreel I've put together that I will send through, you thoughts on that would be greatly appreciated too :) \n\nThanks again for the great feedback, I hope your week is good and a little more normal than the last!",
