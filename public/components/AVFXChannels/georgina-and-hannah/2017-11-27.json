I think for the Christmas concert I'm playing one of my Grade 6 pieces, which is called \"In Dreams\". It's from LOTR, not very Christmassy, but I think everyone likes LOTR to some degree lol. I hope Paris was good haha!! I've been to France before, I went to Caen on this school exchange back in Year 5. I went on my birthday which was funny. I spent most of my 10th Birthday on a ferry haha.",
