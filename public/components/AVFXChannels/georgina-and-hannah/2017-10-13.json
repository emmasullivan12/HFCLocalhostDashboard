My name is Hannah (if that wasn't clear), I am 15 (mentally -6) and I'm just about surviving year 11 so far. My massive passion is Music. I play the piano and I kinda play guitar, and I love listening to music. I am a massive k-pop fan! \"Massive\" is an understatement; I'm more *O B S E S S E D* haha. I have a problem I know. I surprisingly enjoy playing classical pieces on piano more than I like playing songs. I'm working towards my Grade 6 in piano at the moment :grinning: . I also plan to study music in college. I've already applied for a BTEC Diploma in Music Technology and a BTEC Level 3 in Music Performance. I hope one day to study Music in uni as well, hopefully internationally too! I also love books and films (the book was better regardless the book- to - film adaptaion haha). I also really like food and bubble tea. I think that's about it?",
