Ah, I'm glad you cleared up the whole A-Level thing, as you must be slightly insane to study 4 A Levels properly. \n\nI've applied for BTEC Music Performance and BTEC Music Technology. From what I've been told it's almost 100% coursework (so no stressful exams in exam season after the two years). It's way more vocational compared to the A-Levels. I study GCSE music at the moment so it's going to be quite a change to what I'm used to.",
