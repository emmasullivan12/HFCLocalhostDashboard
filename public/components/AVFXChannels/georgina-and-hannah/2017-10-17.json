I am aware of how much studying is involved in an A level, and they only really offer people 3 at a time now because of all the work! What was music A-level like for you? I'll be studying BTECs though, so it won't be exactly the same, but i'll get a rough idea. \n\nYou also studied at Cambridge?! I have dreams of prestigious universities in mind too. I really want to study internationally, specifically South Korea (surprise haha). Their equivilant of Ox-bridge is SKY (Seoul National, Korea and Yonsei University), and I would really love to go to Yonsei university to study music. What sort of skills did you learn other than music related things?\n\nI think I would love to persue a carrer as a concert pianist! I would love to play at the Proms one day haha. I love playing piano so much and it's really the only thing I'm good at :joy:, so I might as well persue in it. Did you have musical aspirations before deciding to work in an office?",
