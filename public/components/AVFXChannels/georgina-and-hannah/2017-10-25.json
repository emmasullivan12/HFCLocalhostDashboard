I don't understand the concept of half term if teachers are just going to make us do homework and revision the whole time haha. \n\nI'm looking foward to studying BTEC as it's much more practical which I'm super happy about. I've heard of the ABRSM music theory stuff, and I know I need to study it if I want to do a high piano grade, so I hope to study it. And I do have a piano teacher, although I don't know if she'll do music theory with me as I'm doing my grade 6 on the Trinity exam board, not ABRSM. \n\nHaha, I hope your work band is entertaining lol. Have a good day :slightly_smiling_face:",
