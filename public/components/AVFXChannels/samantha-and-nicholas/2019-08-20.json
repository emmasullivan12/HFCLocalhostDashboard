There is some great stuff he’s posted already too. \n\nI’ve meet on or two but generally I’m just taking the individual classes for Houdini. I originally came from Otis and have stronger ties with my friends from their. Most are working over at Cosa as Lighters and Animators. One of the reasons I’d like to get into vfx is so I can work with them, because I really enjoy working with close people. My job currently is more closed off in a sense so like to make the switch soon. \n\nYea I was thinking of including maybe a blog section of some kind that way it be getting in the habit of adding updates on just learning materials. \n\nLols real time-fx is really interesting in which the number one thing I’ve found in video games is how to cheat the look of everything. Unreal is def. great with its lighting and friendly artist tools for shaders\/material setups. Unity is great tool and they just introduced their shader\/material graphs like Unreal last year. I feel in game engines the biggest techniques to real time fx tends to be animating shaders and help geometry. \n\nGenerally <http:\/\/realtimevfx.com|realtimevfx.com> is the place to go, but personally looking at old school video game break downs tend to show off how to get away with a lot of things. Also a lot of indie developers post stuff up on their twitter on their vfx development too. \n\nLols so if you play a lot of video games looking at devs blogs usually tend to show off how the were able to fake things cuz everything in real time revolves around frame rates\/ optimizations. \n\nHopefully I can make a better list sometime this week for you. What kind of resources have you found so far for real time vfx? Also have you thought about looking into Houdini as well? Cuz I know Houdini’s platform in making tools for procedural modeling is def a standard for game devs. Which is funny cuz as much as I’d like to work towards that for games it’s a whole separate zone.  \n\nOhhhhhhh there’s a realllly good GDC talk about this I thought was really good in terms of Houdini pipeline for Game dev. Also if you follow the guys twitter it has a lot of cool vfx things he did with Houdini and how he used it in unity. <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/326563304> \n<https:\/\/80.lv\/articles\/006sdf-developing-an-indie-adventure-platformer\/amp\/?__twitter_impression=true>",
