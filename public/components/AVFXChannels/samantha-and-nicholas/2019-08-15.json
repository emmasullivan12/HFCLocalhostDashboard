I'd work at a place for 3 months as an unpaid intern, then get hired as freelance for another 3 months, then be let go. This was normal for me for like 2 years. Then I finally got my foot in a small VFX house doing music videos for a year. Unfortunately that company went under so I was jobless again. I ended up getting a job at a huge vfx commercial house as a runner, since I didn't have a lot of experience to be hired on as an artist just yet. Which if you don't know what a runner is (I didn't when I first applied) you essentially serve clients, clean up dishes from other artists, complete errands producers need help with, and other similar small tasks. Although I wasn't doing anything in 3D as a runner, I was at least getting paid working at a huge established VFX house and I got to talk to other modelers\/texture artists who helped give me feedback on personal work. After being a runner for 4 months, they gave me a chance at modeling on a project on a Super Bowl commercial. Ever since that project I never went back to being a runner, I'm now a mid-level modeling\/texturing artist, and I've had this job for 4 years now.",
