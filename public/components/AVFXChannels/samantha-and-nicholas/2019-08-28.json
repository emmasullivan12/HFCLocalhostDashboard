It was extremely difficult as a modeler to make all the characters and environment work for AR. lol You are extremely limited to polycount for AR. I can't show you the real wireframes of the model we used, but here is an example of the poly count we had to have for each character.",

We started with the 3d models used in the movie (100k polys), and we had to downres them (to 300 polys). Then we had to get all of the UVs (which were in like 30 UDIMS) and have it all into the first UDIM. So we had to bring the low res model with UVs on 1 UDIM, and the film res model with 30+ UDIMs and bake the high res texture maps onto the low res texture maps in Mudbox. Sometimes we had to do separate bakes for each character because they had so many accessories they wouldn't all bake correctly. Then we had to make alpha maps for things like earrings or a gun-ammo belt since it would be too many polys to model out earrings or the gun-ammo belt lol. That was a challenge in itself, we couldn't even model any facial shapes except the mouth lol So they had no eye holes or nose, just a shape for the mouth to move. I felt so limited as an artist it was crazy lol",
