Hope that list comes in handy for you! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThat's great that you still have a connection there! Always try to maintain those relationships, you never know where people end up working or who may need your help later in your career. :slightly_smiling_face: For example this job at The Mill I got because of an old college classmate that I stayed friends with for 5 years! If it wasn't for that friendship, not sure if I would have ever came across The Mill.\n\nHrmm, I personally don't post my work on my social media. Although I do see it's an extremely common thing to do now a days. It doesn't hurt to post up works in progress on social media, unless you rather keep that for a website blog. Posting your work is just a great way for employers to see progression in your work as well as how you complete a project. Because as you are actively working you will come across problems and you have to find ways to solve them. Posting that on social media can be a great way for employers to see that when you come across a problem you take the time to solve it as well. Also social media is something a lot of people are familiar with doing and you can quickly see everything you post. Navigating a personal website is a bit more difficult. Does that make sense?",
