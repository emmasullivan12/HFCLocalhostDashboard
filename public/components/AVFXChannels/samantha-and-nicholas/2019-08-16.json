        "text": "Oh that's all great experience! :slightly_smiling_face: Every new project you do is just more and more experience for you! It may not seem like it now, but each new project you do is making you as an artist get better! That helps a lot that your job right now is already focusing doing 3D work. :slightly_smiling_face: Is there any work you have that you are comfortable with sharing with me?\n\nAh so the college I went to the program was called Computer Animation, but we did everything from lighting, compositing, matte painting, and 3D modeling\/texturing. So I learned how to model there, but the degree was called Computer Animation. :slightly_smiling_face: Every job I got I was focused on learning anything, I wasn't picky if it didn't have to do with modeling, I even helped clean up some mocap animation for a small B-rated movie. I knew I didn't have experience and grasped at any straws of opportunities that came my way. Which from what you've told me about yourself, you seem to be the same way so that's awesome! That's something a lot of employers really admire. I've found myself being hired onto companies longer because I'm always eager to learn more and do things outside of my comfort zone. Also making friends with people is a quick way to be able to jump to other studios as well. Almost every job I got was from word of mouth from a friend who worked there.\n\nAs for personal style, I have always done realistic PBR style models because that's just the kinds of jobs that come in. Though the past year I've been on a more stylized project which has been really different than what I'm used to. Like not sure if you are familiar with the Apex Legends video game, but I helped do the opening cinematic and the trailers for that game. Which is all stylized and different from their video game. Game studios tend to go for more of a stylized look on their trailers and stuff, or you can work in a commerical house and possibly have a chance to work on stylized jobs.\n\nHrmm I can start getting on more in the early morning if that's more convenient for you to talk? :slightly_smiling_face:",

You'd be shocked the number of times I've been assigned a task at work where I thought I couldn't do it. I just had that feeling last month lol. The thing is you just have to keep going forward. Don't be afraid to ask questions, at this stage for you don't ever be afraid to ask for help or suggestions or critique. That's what will help you learn more. The first two years I was at this company, I constantly asked people if there was an easier way to do something than how I wanted to do it. 8 times out of 10, there was an easier method! I wouldn't have known if I didn't ask other. Then slowly I started remembering the tools and learning to apply them in other ways. :slightly_smiling_face:",

Because yeah your model can look great rendered in a still image, but if you don't show how your wireframe looks it could be a hit or miss on how your model would look if it was rigged and animated.
