Also I wanted to apologize for the long silence too. There has been a lot of struggles in various places, but things are moving forward. I still hope we can continue conversing, but I feel I havenâ€™t been working with you to the best of my abilities. So I want to thank you for all your advice and insights. If this might be the last message I totally understand and hope you find success in your endeavors. If there is anything I can do to help you let me know as well.  ",
