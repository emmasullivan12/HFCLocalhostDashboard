I also have a few friends over there right now lol Have you already tried applying at places for intern positions?\n\nGames are definitely on a different level technically compared to VFX. In VFX you aren't nearly as limited in things as in games. Ah I never thought about checking out developer blogs and stuff, that'd be a great idea to see breakdown of how things work or how they cheat things to get the best optimization on things. I do play tons of different video games like I'm on Dragon Quest Builders 2 and Fallout 4 right now. I'll definitely have to take a look at some developers twitter accounts or blogs. :slightly_smiling_face: Never thought about looking at that. Thanks for the advice!\n\nI haven't really looked at any resources for real time VFX but know a few sites from trying to learn how to model\/texture for real time.",
