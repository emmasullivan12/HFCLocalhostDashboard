Jam city looks nice but the art positions are out of my area. Funny thing thou I do have an old coworker that works there waiting for an open ad position to come and snatch me. Random question thou what’s your take on like social media postings in art? I see a lot of game devs post stuff on Twitter and other places and it’s really cool, but I really don’t have that social media drive or maybe it doesn’t feel right to post work for others to see, because of the lack of polish. Then again I’m not really much of a social media type of person either. What about you?  ",
