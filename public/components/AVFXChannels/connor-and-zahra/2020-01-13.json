I do apologise for not responding earlier but I had a very big university deadline that I had to focus on. \n\n I'm a student from University of Hertfordshire and I'm currently in my third year. At the moment I'm a 3D generalist however I'm starting to lean towards CFX. \n \nI find at the moment, I tend to be told that my modelling skills are good and I have a really good understanding of the pipeline but I really struggle to get that finished feel in my work, especially when it comes to texturing. \n \nI have a few showreel WIPs that are currently in texturing phase atm. I would love to get any advice or feedback you have on them as I would really love to up the quality of my work. I would also love any advice you have on showreels in general as I tend to get a lot of mixed advice on them.",

Its a really difficult thing to get right and everyone has their own opinions. \nWhat software to you use for texturing? When you say CFX do you mean creature modelling and texturing or rigging and muscle sims?",
