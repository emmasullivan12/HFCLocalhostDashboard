I don't really fancy secondary school mostly because of the pay but also because of the long hours and struggle for ungrateful teens (I see what some of my own teachers go through) being a professor seems like I would interact with students who love the course like me and would work really hard",

Maybe start by getting some experience lower down in your school or in your old primary school? And then tutoring during uni can be a nice side job that you can do around your timetable etc\nI went for primary for similar reasons you didn't want secondary, namely teaching children who don't care about English or reading, and also I think I'd have gotten bored teaching the same few books over and over!",
