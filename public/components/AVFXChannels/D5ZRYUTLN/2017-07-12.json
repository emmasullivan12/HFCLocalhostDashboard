Because if so, you can ask a few of your teachers if you can come observe\/act like a teaching assistant in a range of ages and subjects. If you can do that for a few hours then you can later exaggerate it and say you've had a week of secondary experience staggered over a term.\nI don't know if you definitely need a PhD because I did have one or two lecturers who were Professor so-and-so rather than Doctor. Most people lecturing either do have a PhD or are working towards it. You'd need to budget Â£10,000 for a masters, just for tuition. So if you were in a position to move back home after uni to save on living costs, you'd be able to save the money you needed for tuition by working summers and maybe a few hours during uni. As for the PhD, that's a little trickier because not a lot of places will support you studying while you work for them, so that might mean you need to take a couple of years to work full time to save up. \nLet me ask around to see if anyone knows anything and in the meantime, we'll get your career plan sorted. Have a look at it and let me know your first thoughts ",
