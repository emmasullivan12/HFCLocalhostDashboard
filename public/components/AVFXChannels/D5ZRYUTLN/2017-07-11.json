It's a trick I've learned: even if the work experience is not helpful or interesting, it looks good on your CV and you can use it to explain why you've gone for teaching at university later. Eg 'I want to lecture and teach university students because, having gained experience in primary and secondary teaching, I can see that I want to be able to specialise closely in what I teach and have the opportunity to teach people with similar passion and enjoyment of literature'\nThat sounds great, keep going with the tutoring. You can volunteer with Action Tutoring once you start university if you're in a city they work from. You tutor GCSE students struggling with maths or English; I've done it and it was so good to help, especially because they aren't in the position to pay for lots of tutoring\nAre you ready to start working on your career plan?",
