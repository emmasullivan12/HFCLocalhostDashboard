It'll probably take a while for productions to ramp up again as well. In terms of working from home it's gone pretty smoothly. We're able to remote desktop in to do very basic tasks and then work locally for more complex shots.\nI'm look-deving an effect for a potential job at the moment which requires quite a bit of sim and render time so that's proving to be a little tricky.\nThe tool we made utilises the crowd system within Houdini. It's a fairly basic crowd generator but does the job for distant shots where we need hundreds or thousands of people. We used Adobe Fuse to generate that characters and got motion capture data from Mixamo.\n\nI'll dig out some Houdini videos for you",
