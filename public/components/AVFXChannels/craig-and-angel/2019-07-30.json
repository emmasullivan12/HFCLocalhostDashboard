Some useful points he bought up and we discussed :\nHulkbuster model looks great and matches ref pretty well :ok_hand:\nSpace ship model - we got into an issue of concept Vs. Modelling skill. As in if it was a real world vehicle like the truck its a bit easier to judge your skills and ability to model to something, but because abstract things like spaceships can be quite loose concepts he felt it puts more emphasis on design and concept and perhaps distracts from the modelling itself?\nThe truck is great - we were discussing if reference should be included in the frame especially for details \/ profiles to show youâ€™ve matched certain features\nAnd the boots we suggested that for such a simple \/ small model it would be great to see much heavier with the detail and have all the creases and stitches modelled in - i imagine more like a high res zbrush sculpt\n\nLike me He did feel you are on the right track for sure :ok_hand:",
