How did you come to be in matchmove instead?\n\nI do like Dneg spent a few years there its a lovely place!\n\nYou do seem to be doing the right things, it is just tough getting those breaks and modelling seems to be particuarly tricky to break into. Unfortunately theres no magic solution thats going to suddenly make it happen but your attitudes great so iâ€™m sure you will crack it. In my field i had years where i felt like i was going nowhere then some years where i made big leaps so sometimes big opportunities come out of the blue!",
