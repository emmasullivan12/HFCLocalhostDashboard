But in proud of it. \n\nAh I see didnt realise that about the spaceship, I got told to remove it due to the topology of the model, so I may remove it because design purpose and topology issue. I wanted to add a reference but in modeling I wasnt sure if I should for a reel, and I did question that. What did you guys think of that, or is it not that important? \n\nThe boots was done all in maya, that got justed on the edge flow and I wasnt sure to keep it in or not. I left it in because it shows a little bit of organic style, but I prefer hard surface much more. \n\nThank you both for looking at it and giving me yours and their opinion its greatly appreciated. I'm currently modeling a helicopter, and for abit iv been struggling with topology because it's a round surface. Any suggestions ? I have retypo a few times and even started poly modeling it.",
