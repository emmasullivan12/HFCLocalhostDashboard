Big problem is pinching in various areas which you can check easier by having a blind shader with high spec and doing a turntable - it should show up the pinched areas and help address them. Other big problem is variation of panel \/ windows inset - so some of them seem to vary between being slightly outset to going inset and need to be more consistent. Again the spec highlights should show this up",
