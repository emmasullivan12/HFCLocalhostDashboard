Which I heard you cant remove just add extra sub. Yes that I got told which I never realised. My worries are in the shape of the window and when I use the cut tool and smooth I loose the outa edges. So its topology I gotta play with. \n\nYeah. I did try to look at things interesting, its slightly hard when you dont want to spend a week. As I know that picking something crazy you can be stuff for months, so I dont want to spent so long and I do question what is it that companies want to see or dep for junior level.",
