I'm super excited to be working with you - hopefully we can work great together and both gets lots out this!\nFirstly, my name is Niki and that is what you should call me! No formalities here!!! Also, I don't think anyone has ever really refered to me by my surname so it would just freak me out! hahaha!\n\nI just started a new job less than 3 weeks ago, so I will confess this is a super busy time for me too. So in general I will make time each weekend to reach out to you and support you. But during the week, generally it is quite difficult to make time. Of course I will check messages if they come in any time, and reply, but for any proper considered message or feedback, I will do that at the weekend! So I hope that's okay with you :slightly_smiling_face: And of course, I fully understand that you're here in your free time too so if I dont hear from you for a while, that's no problem too! I know you've got lots on too! Lives are busy!\n\nI am very excited to hear back from you with more about yourself and how I can help you on your animation journey! 2D forever!!! :star-struck:",
