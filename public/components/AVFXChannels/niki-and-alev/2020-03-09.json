I hope I can help you out with some 2D stuff :slightly_smiling_face: I would love to hear more about you, what your journey has been so far with animation, and what you were hoping I could help you out with!\n\nI'm not sure what you have been told about me, but here is a little bio. I have been in animation for 10 years now, only working in 2D. In that time I have been an animator in Flash, After Effect and Harmony (though Harmony in my own time, as professionally I've been a rigger while using Harmony!) I have work as an animator on a bunch of stuff, mostly for Irish TV. I've worked on I'm A Creepie Crawly, Bottler, Messy Goes to Okido, Zig &amp; Zag and a bunch of other bits. I have worked mostly as a Toon Boom Harmony rigger for the last 3.5 years, working on Rescue Bots Academy, Littlest Pet Shop, Dorothy &amp; the Wizard of Oz and most recently It's Pony, with Blue-Zoo. I live in London now, and I moved back here to work on BZ's first TV show, which was really cool! Now I'm working with Blink Industries on their very first show, which is also incredibly cool. But Netflix will get cross if I talk about it, so you'll just have to trust me about that one. I'll be working in pipeline (organising how the project is filed, stored and tracked and troubleshooting tech issues) on this show and also rigging and possibly a bit of animation too! I just started there 2 and a bit weeks ago, so it's very new!\n\nAside from work, I love live music and movies. A bit of a foodie too, so love trying new places to eat or types of food! I Netflix and chill quite a lot in my spare time too! :smile:\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you and hopefully helping you out a bit!\nNiki",
