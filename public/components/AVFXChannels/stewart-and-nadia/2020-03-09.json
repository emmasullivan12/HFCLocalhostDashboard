The company I work for now isn’t huge and we encourage artists NOT to work late. \nIn a creative industry you’ll generally find a pleasant working atmosphere compared to other jobs. But there’s always exceptions unfortunately. I worked in a company that made commercials and the work culture was fast paced and stressful.\nYou’ll be surprised as to how many people you’ll meet in animation with a similar outlook on life.",

Would you say its easy or at least easier to make friends with work colleagues in animation? I generally find it difficult and hold hope that it'll be easier in the work environment I want to be in since animation is something I love so much",
