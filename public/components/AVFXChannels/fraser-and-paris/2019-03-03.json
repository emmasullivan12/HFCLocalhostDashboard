Nobody wants to see a film that the filmmaker has made whilst feeling numb to it - nor do you want to make that film. Seen as you pointed out the importance of these, I see this as a key area to focus on putting across the feeling and idea \/ concept by making this move and edit together nicely. Let's see if you can develop something - as short as possible - which interestingly and visually puts across your concept while focussing on this key area only. It could be a worthwhile exercise and something could be found I feel. A beginning, middle and end - or act structure - could be developed from this. What is your technical aim to achieve with your studies - character animation? Modelling? etc.",
