I've been trying to sort my computer for a few days working with the tech support and got to the point where he said to just ask for a repair.

I dropped it to 95 percent and it seems to be working now. I guess that means I'll lose some processor power. I don't know if there's still something that needs to be fixed so I can use 100%",
