I have to put about 20 bits of furniture through it so it would take ages with a normal size one. I might add debris at the end, it would definitely be better. We talked about it for the last project I did amd they said it wasn't necessary as the sims are for selling the models. When I cam use them for my reel I'll add debris and some dust probably",
