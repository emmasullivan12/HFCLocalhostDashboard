I use * in hscript sometimes to refer to 'anything' eg deleting all attributes. What would be the equivalent in vex? I want to create a new group or attribute with all primitives which are part of a group with 'wood' or 'steel' somewhere in the name of the original group. Hope that makes sense. Thanks for your help!",
