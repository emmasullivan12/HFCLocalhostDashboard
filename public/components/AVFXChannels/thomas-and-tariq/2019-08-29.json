CFX is closer to FX work than Crowd or possibly Groom. so if you have any muscle\/CFX stuff, that's probably better in FX. As for Crowd and Groom they would personally keep them separate if you can.\nSo if you're applying to smaller studio, it might be worth having a \"generalist\" FX\/CFX\/Crowd reel, but for larger studios, you'd want to have a reel that focuses on the  role you're applying for. So the FX reel if it's an FX artist, or Crowd reel if it's for Crowd.\nIf you've just graduated though, it would be worth just having a \"generalist\" reel handy anyway, and to not 100% specialize until you're 100% sure",
