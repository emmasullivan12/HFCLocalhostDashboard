I'm working on the build of our Prospela web &amp; app platforms, having previously worked in marketing &amp; finance with a large company that owns McVities, Carrs, Jacobs, Jaffa Cakes, Ice Gems (and many more!). I'm also on the board of a large youth network charity. So hopefully I can shed some light on these areas for you!\n\nI also noticed you said medicine might be something you're considering. Is this as well as or instead of computing? I did biology at AS and then dropped it, but was considering  medicine as an option whilst at school. \n\nIt would be great to hear a bit about your interests and what you would like support with over the duration of this mentoring programme (approx. 2 months).",
