I'll make up for it on the weekend!)\n*I worked on:* some high level thinking about our business over the next few months and confirming with my co-founder which direction we should go in vs what direction potential customers\/investors might want us to go on. It's good to keep stakeholders in mind.\n*My colleague gave me feedback:* saying I made some good points on high level thinking. :muscle:\n*I read:* a bit about the budget the government announced and was thankful there were no impacts on our business and startup! always good to keep an eye on the bigger picture that might effect your plans.\n*I felt:* like taking a much needed afternoon off. I'll get back on top of things Thursday...:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:",
