I just spoke with one of their hiring team and they say they take BTEC students and people who have studied anything really, as long as they can show interest in computing and the industry.  I didn't know, but IBM apparently have one of the biggest design teams in the world (I.E. for user experience and front end design like what you have been learning). I think you would have a very good chance of getting an apprentice with them :). When you are done with your English retake I'm happy to help you with your CV and application so just let me know :+1: :ok_hand: :grin:",
