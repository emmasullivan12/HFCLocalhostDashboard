Those that do well can talk to groups of people and persuade them to do something and lead a team. \n\nThis applies to any department i.e. a finance team, marketing team, sales team or IT team. It helps you stand out from the crowd and your peers. This is especially true in areas such as IT\/coding as your peers are likely to be less experienced or able to speak well &amp; lead large groups of people. So if you can develop 2 very different but complimenting skills (such as coding\/IT and being a good public speaker\/leader) then you will do well. \n\nIf you have opportunities for public speaking",
