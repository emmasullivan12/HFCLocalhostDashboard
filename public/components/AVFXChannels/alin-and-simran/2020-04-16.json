The deadline is 11th May so I need to get a move on, filter out bad work from my reel and website \n\nI’ve tried to do some character modelling but I’m so bad at it:joy: everything just looks like an alien head\n\nI was thinking of finding something hard surface but has organic modelling in it...\n\nI’m not sure on whether to model architecture maybe instead? which has organic shapes, like rococo, ill need to spend some time figuring it out \n\nThat showreel looks amazing! :raised_hands::skin-tone-4:Definitely need to work on my presentation and find more complex models to work on \n\nThank you so much! I’ll update you with new work when I have some hopefully soon :blush:\n\nYou take care too!! \n",
