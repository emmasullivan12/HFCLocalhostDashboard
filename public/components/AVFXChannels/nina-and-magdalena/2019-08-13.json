I’ve heard quite a few horror stories about that!\n\nWow it sure sounds like you’ve had an interesting run of your career, that really gives me hope honestly. :)\n\nBut yes that is what I am most interested in! I dabbled in comp in Nuke for a while as well and quite enjoyed it, but idk. We are expected to more or less focus on one thing when creating a portfolio and so I mostly abandoned any projects beyond modelling\/texturing. And that would be amazing!!",
