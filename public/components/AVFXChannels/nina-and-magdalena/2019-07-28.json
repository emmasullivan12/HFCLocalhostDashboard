        "text": "Hey! Sorry for the late reply, I just got back from holiday! 3D design that sounds really cool! Are you designing character art in a 3D software or more like concept artwork? I have been there too, it can sometimes be tricky to get your foot in the door. It took a bit of time for me as well. The important thing is just to not give up! Keep on applying, even if you don´t match all of the required skills, just being open and willing to learn is just as important when you are starting out. In the meantime adding new things to a portfolio is always a good thing. Actually there are some really nice podcasts I can recommend that give great advice on portfolios and preparing for interviews. First one is from AnimDojo  <https:\/\/animdojo.com\/blog\/animdojo-podcast> and Access Vfx of course <https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/accessvfx> :slightly_smiling_face: Also I can´t recommend AWUK enough. They just launched AWUK- Ed to support students and graduates <http:\/\/www.animatedwomenuk.com\/awuk-ed\/> . Hope you have a lovely rest of the weekend!",
