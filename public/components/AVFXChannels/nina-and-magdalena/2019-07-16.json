I wanted to apply for an internship you guys had back in May but I chickened out :sweat_smile:\nSo I graduated last year with a BA in 3D design and animation and honestly have been stuck for a while. I enjoy character art the most of the whole pipeline, but I know it’s highly unlikely to get hired for that position as a junior :(  I’ve been working retail jobs throughout uni, now I’m a supervisor in a coffee shop and trying to to work on my portfolio in the meantime.",
