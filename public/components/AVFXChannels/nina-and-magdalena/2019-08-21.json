I asked a modeller here about what to put in a portfolio\/reel if you are aiming for a modelling career. She said if you are planning to get into an animation studio it would help to have some cartoony work in there as well, to cater your reel to where you want to work. Main thing to put in would be props as that's mainly what you would start doing as a junior. Also to get a design (like from pintrest for example) and make it from that. It will show that you can get a design and be able to work with it, which is basically the whole job :slightly_smiling_face: As well as getting into the habit of having a good eye for detail in design. Hope those tips are useful!",
