We do all sorts of animated content but I'm currently working on an animated children's series. I also have a background in multi-media, which is how I started my career working as a graphic designer at a broadcasting company.  How about you, could you tell me a bit about yourself and what you were hoping most to get out of the mentor ship?  I'm more than happy to give advise, feedback on work etc.",
