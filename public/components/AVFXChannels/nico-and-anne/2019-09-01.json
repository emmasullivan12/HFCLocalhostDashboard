How does your girlfriend like Rodeo so far? i’ve been thinking, maybe we could have lunch sometimes with Aélis ? It’d be nice to meet and chat. Take care! ",

Place des arts is alright, we tend to be weirded out by everything but it's a cool place. Rodeo seems fine but we're already feeling strange about how picky companies here are regarding taking holiday time. Otherwise it's been quite fun :)",
