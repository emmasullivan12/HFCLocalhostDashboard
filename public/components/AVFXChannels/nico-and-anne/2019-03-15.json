Transitioning from web design and motion design into VFX.\nSelf taught in the beginning then did two different courses on compositing. First being NAD school here in Montreal. This was a 12 weeks compositing program. I really enjoyed it. Introduced me to some basic keying, integration, 2D and 3D tracking, a bit of roto and Paint.\nThen I got hooked and got the opportunity to do the Framestore Launchpad training which i loved. Worked for Framestore as a paint and roto artist for a bit then switched to Atomic Fiction. Spent a year there, and learned a lot but haven’t been able to really put my comp knowledge into practice. Now i’m working on building a reel with a little bit more comp work as my goal is ideally to find a position as a junior comp here in Montreal. It should be done in about two weeks max, I would love to send it to you and have your thoughts and advice on it so i can push it further.\n\nI would love to learn more about you and your background. What’s your story, how did you end up in London working as a comp artist?\nOnce again, thanks for your time! have a great day!",
