The engineers won the war and slowly displaced any semblance of art education out. We got caught on that silly conflict and it really hurt us; I was part of the second promotion, by the end of the career i couldn't draw and couldn't program either. What I could do, was to Maya like a champ (for Colombian standards) thanks to 3 years of maya worshop classes that somehow managed to go unscathed in their little turf war.",
