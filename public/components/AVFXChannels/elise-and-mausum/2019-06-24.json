So sorry for my late response!\n\nI actually applied to the Greenlight Graduate Programme at DNEG and got shortlisted and then invited to their assessment day last week. Should hear back from them any day now so fingers crossed!\n\nGraduation is on the 8th of July and I'll be graduating with a first :D so hopefully everything works out in the end.\n\nHope you're well,\nMausum",
