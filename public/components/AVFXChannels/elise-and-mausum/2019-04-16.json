Thank you!\n\nI did go on a placement for my 3rd year of Uni at Peerless in Covent Garden, they were pretty small at the time and so the running tasks were small and I got a chance to do smaller clean up shots and muzzle flashes. It was really cool and quite invaluable experience wise. I felt like I learnt alot about the general pipeline and workflow of smaller companies. I got a chance to do some VFX Coordinator work for a show as well and they've said they'd like to have me back after i've finished.\n\nI'm quite open to returning there as I know the crew and they are aware of my current skillset and where I want to go so can help me train up in that aspect, which I can't see a downside to.\n\nI didn't want to completely close off any other opportunities either though so was contemplating applying for Framestore's Launchpad and DNeg's Greenlight internships for grad students too.\n\n:blush:",
