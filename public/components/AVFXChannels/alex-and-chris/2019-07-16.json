I think programming would give me a big advantage but I wouldn’t know where to start with it at all. \nOver the summer I really want to work on my env general pipeline skills, maybe by building a scene from scratch. I’ve done this a couple of times before but have always been constrained by university deadlines. \n\nIt’s awesome to hear you’ve worked on cinematics too. I’ve spent a bit of time with Hugo Guerra who is really well known for his cinematics now and because I’m interested in games I think I’d like to work on cinematics\/trailers! ",
