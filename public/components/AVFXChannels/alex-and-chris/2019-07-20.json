I want to try all sorts of Envs really but I love Sci-Fi and cool, crazy looking things. When you say find a concept on ArtStation, do you mean find some drawings that someone has done to then build an env from? \nYes I’ve heard that cinematics are more done in other parts of Europe so maybe that’s something for later on in my career...
