In my opinion the main goal of your env has to be making it as good as you can. For that you need a great concept(don't do the concept yourself please :slightly_smiling_face: , look  for the great one on the artstation). Portfolio wise it's better to have one stunning piece rather than 4-5 average ones. What type of env do you want to do? I can help you with setting the quality bar and give feedback along the way if you want.  Also I can guide you with python basics but that would require you to put on hold env I guess, so if I were you I would pick one route and stuck to it till the end of summer  at least",
