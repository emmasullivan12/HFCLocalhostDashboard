In this title, lead technical artist Christophe Desse takes us through the paces of learning Painter by sharing his production proven techniques and workflow . His direct approach allows the student to learn how to quickly tackle projects without feeling overwhelmed with the interface, terminology or workflow. Starting with a detailed introduction to the tools and features, Christophe then goes deeper into the workflow of Substance Painter showing the texturing process on a full project by texturing a detailed walker-bot model and its driver. This allows him to share his workflow for texturing both character and hard surface models. He shares various techniques that can be used to texture various components while discussing how to handle the various material settings and maps. Many different types of materials are textured and demonstrated, providing a thorough insight into Christophe’s methodology. Topics include the Painter interface, display and viewport features, transparency and Iray, Textures Sets and Materials, Smart Materials, Projections, Stencils, Baking, Anchor Points, and how to approach hard surface weathering and detailing.",

He starts at the very beginning with the development of an idea with research, reference and exploration. Devon then discusses how to expand on your ideas with clear steps towards working efficiently and creatively. Topics include reference gathering, blocking-out scenes through effective layout techniques, modeling, lighting, texturing, painting, rendering and the exploration of new tools. Through this project, Devon demonstrates how to get the full benefits of programs that include Maya, VRay, Photoshop, ZBrush, and others. As his science fiction inspired alleyway is full of narrative detail, Devon explains the importance and application of composition, set dressing, storytelling, realism and the final post techniques that create an immersive environment. By the end of the lesson and demonstration, artists should have a clear idea of how to approach detailed environment work for production.",

Starting off, he will cover basic concepts of asset building including kit bashing, grid space modeling, basic UVs and asset cleanliness. Normal and displacement mapping will also be covered. Dave will then move into his lighting setups using V-Ray. He will discuss lighting and rendering in V-Ray, covering HDRI and physical camera setups, along with efficient render settings. Throughout the class David will be sharing many time-saving tips and tricks that he uses in his day-to-day workflow for 3ds Max, ZBrush and Photoshop.",
