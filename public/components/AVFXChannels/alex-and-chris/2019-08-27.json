If I were you I would make the last push and tried to match the lighting to be similar and correct small scratches here and there to make it look even closer. Like sticker or  text on the side. If you will put that into your reel, which makes sense I guess, make sure to include the ref to showcase that you made it as close as you can,that's really valuable skill in both VFX and games",
