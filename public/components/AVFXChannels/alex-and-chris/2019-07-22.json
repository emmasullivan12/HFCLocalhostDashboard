It's really a tough goal but that would help you understand the production speed. Just don't forget to credit the concept artist,you can even write them to get potential exposure if your env will be that good :slightly_smiling_face:\nHere are some examples of concepts you could go with:\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/onXak> (check this guy in general,he has tons of great stuff)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/oOl6EJ> (task example could be to remove character and make it as photo real as possible and yet preserve the mood)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/oOKWmW>\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/nQLP59> you totally can copy someone's work for studying, just remember to credit the person :slightly_smiling_face:\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/GXJLxV> ( really good one for the mood, and then you can make a moodboard of assets, though it's rather stylized, I'm not sure it's that useful in VFX in particular)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/gJBBLe> (this guys rocks)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/6aP8JO> (extremely easy to reproduce, and very very hireable  outcome)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/e0zYoP> (just for variety you would want to have different envs in your reel)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/2x114A> (pretty common env in films :slightly_smiling_face: Like a set extension or something similar)\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/gJydgG> (If you can pull this type of env off on a level that the concept does but in \"proper 3d\" you will be instantly hireable, but this one is really ambitious one :slightly_smiling_face: )\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/L2eVxl>\n<https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/4WwK1> (this one has a bit poor execution but it's a nice picture in general composition wise and it has castles, you really want to have different types of envs :slightly_smiling_face: )",
