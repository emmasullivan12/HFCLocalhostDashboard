        "text": "Hey Luke! Yeah constraining both hands to an object is a massive pain in the arse. Before anything, you should make sure the object is in its own group before constraining it to anything else. What this does it it allows to you manipulate the object independently of the constraint instead of it snapping back into place every time you try to move the object directly. Make sure you group it at the origin though so the pivot is at the center! As for the actual constraining, the way I usually do it though is having the object constrained to one hand and then have the _other_ hand constrained to the first hand. So basically having left hand to book, and then right hand to left hand as an example.\nIt worked for me the last time I did it! It isn't very easy to figure out though haha.",
