I'm sure you'll have loads of opptunities the delve into each discipline.\n\nI'll ask my friends who work as character designers but if your interested in that job I'd definatly encourage you to apply when jobs open up! On 2D Tv series character designers will be designing everything from props to costume changes to characters so sometimes from what ive seen the more senior character designer or art director will design main characters and then BG characters and props might be more junior designers.\n\nAh The Line is so good! I'd love to work with them too, Funnily enough I might be working with Blue Zoo for this month to help them finish the 1st season of there 2D show Its Pony, I know they've been confirmed for a S2 of that show so im sure they will be looking for animators soon! I'm not sure they have the job position up at the moment but they would usually ask if you have experience in Toon Boom, have you used the software before?",
