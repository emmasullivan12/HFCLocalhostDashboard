I would say my favourite reel animations are probably the very first one (the character is my own and called Ruffles) and the second one with the fox and the firefly as that was a very challenging one when I first got it. Also the fox jumping from behind the bush because cute factor XD.",

I do think I need to practice animation more and I was always under the impression that character design was a \"higher up\" job, so I assumed during graduationg that I should prioritise animation. Problem is I love character design just as much for different reasons.",
