With regards to texturing\/ lookdev a glass bottle, the model needs to have a thickness to the glass to get an accurate result, make sure opacity is turned off. Set your diffuse to black, your specular colour to white, set your specular roughness to 0.2, and set index of refraction to 1.33. Set transmission to 1, if you want a green glass bottle you change the transmission colour to your required colour, you can then change the transmission depth to get a stronger colour. I would then reccomend painting some surface imperfection maps that can be colour corrected and overlayed on your bump, transmission and roughness to get some breakup. The roughness will dictate how clear the transmission is on your bottle",
