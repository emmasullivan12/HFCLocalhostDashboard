Thanks for your words, that's all very true, and it always helps to hear it from someone else!\n\nIt's a bit horrible sometimes to move up as an intern somewhere, isn't it?? It should be the ideal case but people never stop seeing you as an intern\/runner\/PA. It's good to hear you felt similar things although sorry this was the case at all!\nHow long have you been with your current company? Have you moved up there or did you come in new from elsewhere?\n\nAre there any feature animation resources you would recommend or jargon I should be aware of\/learn? Technically the jobs won't be too different, as VFX has a lot of the same departments and so on, but I always like to be prepared or learn as much as I can! If there is some sort of website everyone in the animation industry uses or something I should be aware of or a book that's a bit of an animation bible I'd love to hear it :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nAll the best,\nLisa",
