Yes I totally agree re the salary - it is sad, but I think that the reality is that lots of people ask for more than they are offered, so companies allow for that (and traditionally it’s women that just accept the first offer). I’ve been in situations where what I have been offered is that maximum that a company have agreed to pay, but in general I think it’s almost expected now that you play the salary game. I’ve just learnt that if I am not happy with what is being offered having the conversation no matter how awkward is worth it - if a company can afford to pay for you they will, and if not they’ll tell you what their maximum is, so that you can make a decision.\n\nIt sounds to me like you have made the right choice in terms of progression - I had a similar situation where I struggled to have certain people take me seriously as I had been an intern. I had to ask my boss to tell a department head that I had his full trust and that what I said went, as they always told me they’d check with him, which was so frustrating and undermining. I’ve found that being somewhere new has allowed me to assert myself more easily. \n\nAnyway congratulations and if there is anything I can help with let me know! \n\nBest \n\nMicaela ",
