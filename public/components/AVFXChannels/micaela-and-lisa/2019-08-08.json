How fantastic that you took part in that Helen North Achieve Programme, I would love to hear more about it! Can I just send you a very quick question right now? I've actually just received a job offer to work in feature animation (exciting!) so now I am obviously considering between my current job and that new role. You've written about your feelings about hours on set vs work in an office and from what you say I can tell we are on the same page! As much as I love set work and I don't mind pulling the hours to finish off a project at all, I do very highly value the ability to still have a bit of a life outside of work. I've heard that in animation it's usually the case that deliveries go sequence by sequence in an almost continuous fashion (so not like in film where there is a mad scramble at the end) - have you found that too and how do you find the hours? Obviously this must be different from company to company, but I do wonder whether 'deliveries all the time' means 'always overtime' (even if it's just an hour per day) or whether you find you can leave on time besides maybe sometimes?\n\nThanks so much for your advice and can't wait to chat more generally :slightly_smiling_face:\nLisa",
