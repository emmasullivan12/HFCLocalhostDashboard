(Sorry, Slack).\n\nGlad to hear you are doing okay :slightly_smiling_face: May I ask what inspired you to sign up to all this?\nAnd I think on your original profile it said you were interested in Marketing too, would you like to change jobs\/direction of your career?\n\nI like the new job! I think there is a lot of stuff that worked better in my old office but I do really like this team here. I think the film will be great too - but still verrrrry far to go until it is watchable. We got our first 4 shots approved the other day. Not so long since I've joined but some others have worked on this project for 1-2 years already...so...at least we are getting somewhere!\n\nHope you get to enjoy the pre-Christmas time a bit!\nLisa",
