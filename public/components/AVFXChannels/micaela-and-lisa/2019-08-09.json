Depending on the structure of the schedule there would normally be internal or sometimes external dailies, which means a more structured workflow and less of a mad rush at the end. Sometimes I’ve worked in reels, which means that there are pressure points, but I think it’s still less stressful than vfx as they are spread out. This of course depends hugely on the client and the schedule, but from conversations with colleagues who have done both I think that animation is better than vfx in terms of mad scrambles.  Depending on the role and the department you are working for, may also impact on your hours. \n\nSorry if that answer is a bit vague, I don’t want to make promises on behalf of the animation industry that may not be true, but I hope it helps with your decision. I also think that you’d be perfectly at liberty to ask them for more information if you want to? I’d be happy to proof read a draft email before you send it if you do decide to ask questions. \n\nLet me know what you decide, and remember, if you do go for it, don’t accept a salary you’re not happy with, as it will annoy you for the rest of your contract. If you’re taking on more responsibility make sure that is recognised in the salary.\n\nAll the best \n\nMicaela ",
