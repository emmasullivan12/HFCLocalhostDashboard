I heard that everyone that went to BFX was guaranteed a job in industry, oh and there are lots of mentors from different companies that are attending BFX for mentoring. I definitely know that there are mentors from Bluezoo but I'm not sure who exactly, and also some from Jellyfish. I think some people from Dneg are mentoring too but I'm not sure, it would be so cool if you came down to mentor and meet you in person.",
