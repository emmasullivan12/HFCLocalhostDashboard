Im so thankful for all the information you provided me about whats happening in industry. thanks so much for the feedback too on the showreel, I have learnt quite a bit so I will definitely go back and change the weight of the gymnastic section.\n\nFor our FMP short animation, we are aiming for that pixar style and i think we can achieve this because we outsourced our character, rig and groom. one of my friends in the group knows friends from industry because she was from Bournemouth in the year above but when she came to Ravensbourne she transferred to the year below (my year). We thought of this idea from summer but our tutor worries that our group will fall apart like previous years, but I think our group is strong enough to create a successful short.\n\nI handed in my dissertation after new years and hopefully we will get it back soon. I think i did okay in the writing department!\nIn terms of internships, I think bluezoo will open them up soon so im planning to apply there. Also my friend was talking about an internship at MPC and its in Canada, I would love to apply but they do creature animation which is a bummer. My friend said how she knew a person who was a character animator but after that internship, she is now known as a creature animator even though she has a passion for character.\n\nOh yeah i know about animdojo, Bader came to our school and told us about it, with focusing on fmp i dont think i will apply for animdojo yet.",
