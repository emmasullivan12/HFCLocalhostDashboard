        "text": "Hi! Studios are all adapting to working from home as we don't yet know how long it'll last. This also means that recruiters are still working and will be reviewing applications even during a lockdown period. Looking at events such a trade shows, past the month of May nothings been canceled yet. The coming weeks will give us a better idea if the state of things but you should still apply for internships. I'll ask around and see if the studios are thinking about doing something about the internships but in my opinion it's too early to tell. I personally would avoid travelling and keeping to internships in the UK but since we are still at a point where we don't know much, keep applying as you were doing so before. How are you holding up? Is Hertfordshire still open?",
