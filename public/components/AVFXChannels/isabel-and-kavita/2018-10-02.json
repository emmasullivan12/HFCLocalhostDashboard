Shortly before I sat my exams I realised that law was not for me as a profession and that what I really wanted to do is to work in a bank _ think of glamorous lifestyle and going out after work ;-)))) So applied for LOADS of jobs and git lucky and never looked back! So let me know why you want to into law - I am really curious to hear about it!!!",
