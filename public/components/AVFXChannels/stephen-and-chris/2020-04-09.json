        "text": "The tough thing about cg suping and i think the reason theres no tutorials or anything like that is it can be so varying dependent on the job and also the day - a lot of the tough decisions and i think what makes a good commercials sup is the ability to take the issues that pop up and find successful solutions to those issues. And 99% of that is purely knowing what the artists are capable of that you'll be working with .\nas an example This spot:\n<https:\/\/www.diyphotography.net\/iphone-ad-portrait-lightning-iphone-x\/>\nthis spot was shot in spain. the initial concept for this was the girl walked through multiple locations with differently lighting apparatuses popping up around her. he'd ride down some escalators with barndoor spot lights popping up, through some turnstiles with bounce boards unfolding and bouncing around her.\nIn the end apple top dogs didn't like the edit they had,  so they called us in to ask what we could do with the footage they had. Honestly i think depending on who we'd have had in that meeting they may not have ever finished it. They were prepared to shelve it, but our 2D head was confident we could pull it off.\nwe too all the footage of the girl from different locations that we could get, sent our sup back to the location and he photographed from the different angles for us that we were planning on using. We then build out he location and projected and matte painted each shot to try make it look like she never went anywhere.\nIt's a shame the original one isn't around to see the difference -- it was a hugely challenging project as we were animating all the lights which are obviously interactive and therefore the lighting had to be captured in camera",

        "text": "Good morning! Yes, that's correct. I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what I'd need on a set. I just am unsure of what all I could be missing from my experience because I have just never worked with other VFX pros before. It's just been me kind of fumbling my way through stuff and figuring it out haha.\n\nHere's two shorts where I sup'd and did the VFX for The Skit Guys. I will explain my process.\nSuperdads: <https:\/\/skitguys.com\/videos\/super-dads> - I helped write and shoot this one. I did VFX as well.\nThe Bee Farm: <https:\/\/skitguys.com\/videos\/awkward-invite-bee-farm> - I helped shoot this one and did on set VFX supervision. I did VFX as well.\n\nFor Superdads I helped write it. So there were a lot of things in the process the team wanted to to and since I knew I'd be handling VFX I suggested writing in different directions. For example, they really wanted a dragon battle and a sea monster battle in the first draft. I told them both of those would require advanced modeling, rigging, water\/fire simulations, etc. So we should pick something more like a robot or rock monster that would be less organic and more static in its movements. I knew I could probably handle the 3D in that area. So that's how we got the 3D hornet.\/wasp. There were other things as well that I changed that lead to him picking up the car rather than a huge log. I think they also helped better serve the story and made more sense for our location\/budget.\n\nOn set I did things like took panoramic images of the surroundings for the 3D models when rendering. I watched camera moves for purposes of knowing if they were trackable if we knew VFX would be in the shots. I helped build a supervise a seesaw rig to raise and lower the blue hero character when he flies.  We had some practical effects mixed in with VFX in the paper scene when it's all falling. So I helped sup that shot to get the paper falling where we wanted it. And probably 1000 other small things I can remember as we went throughout the shoot including making suggestions to wardrobe on the costumes and stuff like that.",

I'd feel ridiculous walking into DD asking for a vfxsup roll.\nIt's actually one of the reasons i left chicago -- as much as i loved my office there, 90% of the talent was jr at the time and i wasn't getting exposed to any growth. i thought i know i has a lot to learn, so jumped at the opportunity to head back to LA. felt really behind when i started back there again. It's tough if you don't have others around you to help you figure out new techniques etc. You have the advantage of being multi disciplinary and already having an idea of that it takes to get a shot done. My experiences, esp in the 2D realm, have come from me buddying up with a 2D op. I don't know how confident i'd be taking on a 2D heavy sup job purely cause it takes me longer to breakdown whats achievable and what i think my team would be capable of.  It's not to say i couldn't do it, but as you know on set time is money and folks don't like hesitation when questions need answering. I like to ponder every angle when it comes to the heavy 2D questions, and that's not always appropriate. Truth be told, i have no interest in doing that anyway. if there wasn't a heavy cg element to it i'd take my self out purely from a selfish interest level",
