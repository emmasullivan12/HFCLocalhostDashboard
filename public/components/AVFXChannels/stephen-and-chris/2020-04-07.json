There are only a few guys here that do VFX at a high level that I know of. And with my current job, The Skit Guys, there is opportunity as well. I guess you would already consider me the VFX\/motion graphics\/animation department. We have a really unique market where a person with a VFX and CG expertise might be able to make some big strides in. We are in pre-prodcution for our first feature film that is in partnership with Sony\/Provident Films and KLove radio. We were supposed to start shooting next week. But the virus put a hold on it for the time being. The film needs some VFX and a VFX supervisor. But the LA producers on the film won't really consider me seeing as I just don't have the experience yet.  And they don't have the budget to hire a big VFX house. So I don't see any reason why in situations like that where the company I work for needs a VFX supervisor that I shouldn't be able to fill that role. Those are just some of the reasons I want to move forward with this skill set.",
