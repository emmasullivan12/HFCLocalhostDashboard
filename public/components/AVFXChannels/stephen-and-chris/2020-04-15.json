Funnily enough I was talking to a mate about how expensive nuke is. Not sure about educational versions etc. \nI am sure though there's a lot that would come from this you could take away if you didn't want to learn nuke specifically as like 3D packages, you usually just need to find the method to replicate the technique.\n\nIn saying that, the packages can push your work a lot further and if the goal is to improve, some of the industry standard software is gonna help that\n\nAlso I didn't realize it was on Kickstarter but maybe that makes it cheaper?",
