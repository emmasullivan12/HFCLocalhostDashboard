I know they are a good entry point for a lot of people into the industry because they hire a lot of juniors and let them work on cool, big shows. But they don't pay very well and they are very quick to kick you out again when they don't need you. I for my part have very little interested in working for MPC anymore. Even though their creature department is top notch. Simply because I know I can get a job elsewhere that pays and treats me better.",

Most people I know tend to bake those mesh maps in Substance and then bring them into Mari to use them for their texturing there since the Mari bakers are not that advanced yet. I know there is some really cool real time curvature in the new mari extension pack though",

It's a nice model your friend made there, there is plenty of believable detail in the textures, it's well presented including lighting and breakdowns. There is really not that much in terms of critique :sweat_smile:. Maybe you could have gone a bit higher on the texture resolution since it it such a hero piece. For the most part it's enough, but some areas feel like they would benefit from a higher texture res. Another thing is the fact that everything is kind of the same material. I realize that is the concept of the whole thing. Just as a nod to future hard surface pieces you do: a lot of times the interplay of drastically different materials creates a tension and some interest of its own. So maybe having some rubber parts, carbon fiber, cloth or a really wet blood stain could break up that uniformity :wink:",

There are some really good still life images on the web similar to this. Lots of them are paintings but there are also plenty of CG ones now.
