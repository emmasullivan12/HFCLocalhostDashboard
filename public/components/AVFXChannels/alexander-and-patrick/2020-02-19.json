Why don't I start by telling you a bit more about myself and what my experience in the VFX industry has been so far.\nI started off by studying Audiovisual Media in Stuttgart in 2013. A very broad bachelors degree that wasn't just about vfx but rather film, music, animation, computer science, interactive media and everything else that comes to mind.\nAfter graduating I got my first gig at Pixomondo as a CG Generalist on the first season of Star Trek Discovery. Though I am a generalist at heart I always enjoyed lookdev the most so I quickly moved from doing all kinds of things to focusing on lighting and shading.\nThey were quite happy with me and started giving me independent hero tasks more often like full characters or environments. I also got the opportunity to lead small teams on some of the bigger shows and do a few internal workshops.\nAfter I had developed an interest in groom and wanted to move to a different city I accepted a position at One of Us in London. Here I work as a full time groomer (and occasional lookdev artist) now. I'm starting to move towards a leading position so I wanted to get a bit more practice in\nmentoring others and passing on some of the insight I've gained so far.\nUltimately I'd like to move into feature animation and work for Pixar, so I take every opportunity that brings me a bit closer to that goal :D\n\nBut enough about me. Tell me a bit about yourself, what you hope to gain from this and what it is you want to achieve.\n\nCheers,\nAlex",
