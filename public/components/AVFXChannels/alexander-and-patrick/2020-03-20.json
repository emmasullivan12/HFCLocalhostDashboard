Thank you for the detailed feedback I really appreciate it.\n\nHelmet:\nYeah definitely agree with you. A lot of people think that I did it in Substance Painter because overall it looks procedural and there's not much art direction in terms of storytelling. I'll have another go at it in the future in terms of materials like you said and do some experiments with it.\n\nStill Life:\nYeah my still life is the weakest and definitely need to work on the lighting. The Grant Warwick one you sent is amazing! At the moment I'm learning lighting to make my scene dramatic and of course looking at loads of references. I just don't know what to do in terms of tweaking in regards to postproduction ie tweaking lights at compositing (Nuke) and tweaking other AOV's",
