It's just that I'm not getting any notification via email when someone sends me a message on Slack. Overall, I'm doing great for now thank you. It's really hard to get hold of software licences even at our university especially The Foundry Products and Houdini\/Arnold. I hope it's not gonna be long till everyone is back working from offices. I'm kind of nervous as well because we're about to graduate and this happens.",

I just want to see Nolan's TENET! That thing is crazy and I love it :smile: Apparently DNEG is working on it and it would be a bummer if the release date is pushed back and that's quite understandable. Are there any films you're anticipating this coming months?",
