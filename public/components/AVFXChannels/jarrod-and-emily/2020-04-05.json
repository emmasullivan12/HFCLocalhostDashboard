It's really cool seeing what people are doing now that they have free time- I saw that Fred made a sweet omelette the other day haha.\nIn regards to treating life like 'rona isn't a thing, that's exactly the plan! 8) We no longer have access to university resources etc,but we do have access to the renderfarm and some free licenses which is awesome. I'm still in my student house, and we've turned the living room into a PC suite so we can keep that work environment going :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:\nIf you have a spare moment I would love to send you everything I'm working on right now and talk about it with you, I'm currently making my final year film which is set to wrap up in May (hopefully!)",
