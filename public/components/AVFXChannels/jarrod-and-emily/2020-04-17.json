It's true that for made up creatures we don't have reference, but we do know things about creatures that do exist, and we can try and apply those to this character. So for example, you've already got quite a few options for the mouth and lips that are used by animators already. I'd love to see a little more control on and around the eyes. Shaping of the brows or around the eye would go a long way to getting this character to emote. Same goes for the tongue as well, especially on that wide open mouth shot. And definitely an ability to flare the nostrils - you've already got the nostrils able to rotate a little bit, but if you can get some controls\/blendshape in there to flare the nostrils to imply breathing? That can go a really long way.",
