I do have a related question for this, though! With all filming being cancelled, is there going to be a lull whilst that picks back up again in a couple months (hopefully!), or is there enough stuff already in production for there to be a constant stream of work? I'm set to \"graduate\" in May (quotation marks because it's been cancelled XD) but I have no idea what I'm going to be graduating into, whether there'll be a sudden demand or everyone is going to be playing it safe etc etc. I've seen a lot of companies announce they're suspending hiring for the time being, but I have no idea how that's going to impact all of us grads when we go into the big scary world. If you have any predictions or wisdomly advice, I'd love to hear it!",
