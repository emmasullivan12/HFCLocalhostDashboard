Mainly because you want a strong foundation to create your models from and unless you are an exceptional concept artist there is no point in creating models based on your own designs. It's also useful to have a decent\/good topology and showcase that with wireframes etc. Some experience with uving and texturing would also be a plus as we don't split the roles really. \nWhen I say good topology I mean like quads and subd style modeling",
