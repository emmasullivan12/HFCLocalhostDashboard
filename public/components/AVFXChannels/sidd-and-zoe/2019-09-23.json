It would still be pretty time consuming I'm guessing so you'd probably have to figure out a schedule that'll accommodate the new workflow. Have you tried using broken line art and boiling techniques? You could pull that off without it drastically affecting your process.\nThe new design looks great here! There's a charm to the colouring style you've chosen here that adds a traditional look, That said the watercolour style takes that to the next level (there's a good chance that the whole thing might look _too_ washed out so do keep that in mind if you go ahead with that style!)",
