I could already imagine the setting and style that you're going for in great detail! It's definitely nailing down the sense of 'whimsy' that I see in children's media which is a great start!\nAs for the art style it does seem that a rougher style would work well with the concept. Do you have any more designs for me to look at?\nIf you're thinking of having a more traditional look then Joanna Quinn's work would be a great reference if you haven't seen it already!",
