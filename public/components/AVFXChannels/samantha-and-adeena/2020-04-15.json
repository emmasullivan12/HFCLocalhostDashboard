Hope you are well and getting on well in your field too with all the Covid going on I can imagine how critical it would be. Possibly what annoys me in the world is the less fortunate ones we see in our everyday lives. I don't really know how that could help me. I also love working with people, however, getting into these amazing life saving jobs, one of the biggest concern is the idea of long shift of working hours. I would rather prefer a part time job. Talking about grades I am expecting them in  between an A or solid or upper B (hopefully) maybe maybe an A* in psychology because I feel like its an easy subject compared to bio and chem. And talking about if I am to go in a job such as medicine (doctor), I won't do the job of a real doctor (I can't bare sick people unfortunately :confused: ), but it would be awesome studying it! And if I am being 100% honest to you then as a child I have been wanting to become a teacher, maybe therefore, I can study medicine or all other interesting science related fields and go to field of teaching (lecturer, high school etc). I am not 100% sure about that either. I will defo have a look at the web link you have sent me and let you if something caught my eye. THANK YOU so much for all your help and support. It was lovely hearing about your job, hope it brings much more to your life :slightly_smiling_face:. PS: yes, psychology is amazing :wink:.",
