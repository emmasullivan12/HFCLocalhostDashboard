It's my pleasure to support you in any way I can!\n\nYou talk about wanting to help people less fortunate than others, as well as a desire to go into teaching. Both very admirable. Have you heard of TeachFirst?? It's a charity that help train teachers to work in state-schools and help disadvantaged children. They are a highly reputable company and it's very respected to work for them. You should deffo check out their website because it's exactly as you say...you could go and study a science-based degree and then teach science within a school. You know there are certain tax incentives to teach a science-based subject too :wink:",
