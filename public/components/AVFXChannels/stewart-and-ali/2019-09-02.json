        "text": "Hi Ali, hope you are well.  I'm not sure what information you know about me, but I've worked in VFX in london for about 17 years.  I'm an animator but I have a more generalist experience when it comes to working in CG.  So I do have some modeling experience, but probably not to the level of quality that's required for final VFX houses these days, and when deadlines are tight I do find myself building assets for projects.   I work in Visualization, which is a fast paced workflow usually covering pre-production and the story-boarding stage of a film,  but as well as previs we often create techvis and postvis for a show.   So the quality of our assets need to be pretty good, and accurate, but then again our scenes to to be light and fast, so the assets need to be optimized as much as possible without loosing too much quality.  It's only at the postvis stage that we try and push the quality a bit more; Where we often receive Lidar scans of environments\/characters\/props  etc.  Anyway  If there's anything I can help you with give me a shout.   Perhaps you can tell me what are of work you're hoping to get into, or what's your ideal job.",
