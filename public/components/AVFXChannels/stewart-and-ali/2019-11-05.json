It would be good to also see the wireframe on shaded with these models.\nI would try and just do as many tutorials out there as you can; there’s so much material out there, and at the same time boost your portfolio.  \nGetting work in the industry is a tricky one, I aimed at small companies as it seemed easier to find opportunities quickly. It’s good that you know different software as some companies may hire you for a different role such as tracking and you could train more on modeling whilst in that role.\nI can also ask other assets artist advice for you, they might have some useful tips.\n",
