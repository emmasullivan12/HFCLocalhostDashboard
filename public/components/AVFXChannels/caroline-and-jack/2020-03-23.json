I decided to go down this route because I wasn't sure if I'd definitely want to do VFX forever as I have barely any experience with it and am aware it's quite a challenging workplace so I didn't really want to go down an apprenticeship route or vfx degree as I figured that would lock me in place while computer science can give me more options down the line. I am more technical than creative I think which also helps but yeah. I'm not entirely sure where I want to go with this to be honest maybe advice on different pathways or anything really. Currently I've been thinking more about potentially getting computer science jobs in general graphics programing maybe for some of the companies like foundry and autodesk that actually create the software that's used in vfx and animation and stuff but yeah that's quite a way away :slightly_smiling_face:",

Around this time I realised I would typically find myself being more interested in watching behind the scenes things for movies and tv shows (I would be more excited for the behind the scenes of the new game of thrones episodes that the actual episodes) so I looked more into vfx and the industry as a whole and just found it really interesting how it's possible to create all these cool things. Since then I realise I probably should have done more to develop my own skills in it and also it's a little ironic that I'm now turning back to computer science but yeah that's just a long way of saying I find the vfx and computer animation (anything cgi) really fascinating and impressive and am more interested in having a career in something I enjoy and am passionate about than one that may pay a bit better but is just boring",
