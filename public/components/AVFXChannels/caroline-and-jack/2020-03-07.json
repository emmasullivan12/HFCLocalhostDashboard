There are a couple of ways we could chat, I quite like setting half a hour aside each week so we can both be online at the same time and have a conversation. Or we could send messages throughout the week when we’re online at different times. Do you think we could set some time aside next week to chat? I’m free on Monday afternoon between 4-5pm. Would that work for you? ",
