Big companies have more robust\/established pipeline and usually they give you a week or two of training time; smaller studio as a more “agile” pipeline more flexible workflow but they rely much more on your personal skills to solve the issue.\nSo its a combination of training on the job and studying from home.\nOne thing I love of this job is that is in continue evolution and you never stop to study and learn... if you want to remain at the top ;-)\n\nWe can speak about this in a chat it will be much faster than writing.",

Currently at SVA we are also taught a intro level to all the different parts of the pipeline and then are able get more advanced knowledge through more advanced courses. The last company I interned with was more advertisement and product based as opposed to entertainment so I am hoping to get a more entertainment based internship this year. A lot of companies are waiting to see how the current virus will pan out so fingers crossed :crossed_fingers:. I am currently trying to improve my demo reel and also work on my senior thesis. It would be great to speak in a chat! Are there chat functions on this app?",
