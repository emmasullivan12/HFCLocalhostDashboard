It’s a lame question I know but it helps me understand your aims.\n\nAnd why nuke? Is it film compositing you want to get into? Because you seem to have some great tv\/commercial\/motion graphic type work. I used to do motion graphics and online editing for tv commercials and I made the jump to nuke so I can understand if that’s what you want to do. ",
