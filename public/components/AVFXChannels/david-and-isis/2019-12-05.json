Let me know how you get on and if you need any help with showreels and cvs just ping me a message. I’ll keep an ear to the ground for internships and things too. Just keep looking around and apply anywhere you could see yourself working, if nothing else it’s good practice! And it’s good to get to know the recruiters too :+1::skin-tone-2:",
