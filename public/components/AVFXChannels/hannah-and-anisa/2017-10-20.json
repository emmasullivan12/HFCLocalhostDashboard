So when I finished a levels I didn't know what I wanted to do and was planning to do business at university because it opened a lot of doors. However, the year I was due to go was the year the fees went up to 9k. Because of this I started looking at other options and there were a lot more opportunities other than going to university.  I came across a qualification that ended up being a better route for accountancy (takes less time, no fees and get experience). ",
