I'm guessing you also did maths which from what I've heard means that there are a number of career paths you can go into with it which was one of the reasons I chose it. Another thing that I wanted to ask was what extra curricular activities would I be able to do to prove that I have leadership skills? I know they are important regardless of career choice. How did you portray leadership skills at my age as a year 12 student? ",
