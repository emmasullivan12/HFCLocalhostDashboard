I look forward to I think the last project because that will have a even bigger focus on the collaboration aspect!\n\nI'd love to watch the podcast about each episode, if you can tell me where to find! I like watching bonus features for films and shows :joy:\n\nI'm really looking forward to Watchmen, that's awesome to hear, I looking forward to seeing the showreal!\n\nThank you for answering the questions! They are very insightful, especially the difference between tv and film! \n\nIn first year we briefly looked at rotoscoping and I went a little further to look at moving Roto for a project and had mixed results, so I was wondering if there is any tips you could give me as I want to go back and have another go. Also is there a way to send my work to you for feedback?\n\nAnd in regards to LinkedIn, that fine is it's an issue! I wasn't aware, am I allowed to follow you instead?",
