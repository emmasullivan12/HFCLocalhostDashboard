Plus having a roto shot that is reasonably difficult on your showreel will stand you in good stead to get a job once you graduate. As a comper being able to do your own roto&amp;prep is a godsend too as it makes you much more desirable to smaller companies who don’t necessarily have people to hand it off to",
