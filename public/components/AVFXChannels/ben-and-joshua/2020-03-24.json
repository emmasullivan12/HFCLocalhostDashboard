I started at my new company then 2 days later they told me they were enforcing working from home so been transitioning to doing that. Its not been easy Iâ€™m not gonna lie to you. Anyway, that sounds like a good idea for a dissertation! Really topical too with alot of work going into that coming in the future I believe. What with Carrie Fisher in Star Wars and those Audrey Hepburn adverts. Will be really interesting to research. How is everything going? Whats happening with your uni?",
