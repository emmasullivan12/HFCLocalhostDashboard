We are in the process of delivering a couple big sequences for a new Netflix show so been pretty intense at work getting all the shots done. I’ve been picking up some really nice shots and some using deep compositing which I haven’t really used before so there’s been a bit of a learning curve but I think I’ve worked out how it works now (until I break it and have to ask my supe what I’ve done wrong :joy:) \n\nI also got a job offer which I was considering but have since decided it wouldn’t have been a good move for me long term. \n\nHow did your hand-ins go?",
