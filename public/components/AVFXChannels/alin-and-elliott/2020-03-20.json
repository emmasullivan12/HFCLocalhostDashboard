At MPC I mainly work on Sonic's redesign and a few characters from Maleficent. So yeah, not a bunch of years in the industry but I got a sense of how things roll - that said, I'm glad to help or answer any questions you might have regarding modeling characters, technical\/artstic, studio environment or whatever else!",
