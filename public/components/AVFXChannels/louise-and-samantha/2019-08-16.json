After uni I managed to get a job at Universal in their TV networks department, this got me into post production and after a brief stint working at Red Bee in the post production facility for channel 4 I got a job at Framestore. I worked their for 3 years as a vfx coordinator before moving to Milk VFX and working my way up to VFX producer. At Milk I worked on films like Fantasic Beasts and where to find them and TV shows like Dr Who. My work as a producer meant I was involved in project from the very start, reading scripts and organising artists to do concepts or create previz and then following the project all the way through to final vfx delivery.\n\nI understand you are interested in preproduction animation? Can you tell me a bit about why you think you are interested in that area and what you think the role would entail?",

I’m thought preproduction because for university project in second year I decided to do an 2d animated show around fake news. And when going through the process of making concepts and storylines and scripts. I personally found the story boarding and character design, coming up with narratives which is something I always done since childhood.\n\nI thought animation as well as when selfteaching I enjoyed the process so much.\n\nFrom the research I done I think preproduction entails a lot of self motivation and planning I know storyboarders look at scripts and work from them also produce animatics which are referenced by animators are sent to visual artist to develop further. I also know visual development artists exist but I’m a little confuse on the term tbh :sweat_smile:",
