They are an ideal stepping stone from education into industry, and we wanted to hear what it’s actually like. So we chatted to 8 of the interns who spent 8 weeks of their summer at Framestore, to hear their experience of what goes on.\nIf you’re thinking of applying for an internship this podcast is essential listening!\n\nFind out how you can apply for internships on the ACCESS:VFX website:\n\n\nHosted & recorded by Grace Hebditch, Marketing Coordinator at Blue-Zoo",
