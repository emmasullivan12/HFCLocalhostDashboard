I'm actually taking a lot of time to work on a completely different project, so I can step back from the interview coaching to focus my efforts on that a little bit more.

I also allow previous clients to \"interrupt\" my break, since it's often less work \/ effort to support people I worked with in the past and helpful to keep revenue from drying up.
