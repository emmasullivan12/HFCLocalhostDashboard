I want to do something which really makes me explore new things, learn different things and look at the world from different perspectives. I thought Architecture was the best, especially because I love Art and I want to continue doing something creative or interesting in life. I was browsing a lot of TED talks and articles about Architecture and they really fascinated me :smile:",
