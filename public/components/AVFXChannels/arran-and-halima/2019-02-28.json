I've got an unconditional offer from Kingston, and an offer from Westminster :slightly_smiling_face:\nI thought my Westminster interview went really bad because other candidates had a lot of work in their portfolio and mine was JUST art work and very limited architecture drawings (so next time I need to make sure I have the correct sort of portfolio) but I did get an offer in the end so it was okay",
