When I came in at the reception I had to wait with 13 other students and then we went upstairs collectively where we were then greeted by one of the Architecture lecturer. He gave us a short presentation of what architecture is and what we will be learning at the uni etc. Then we had a tour of the campus and as we were walking around we got to talk to each other so we felt a little relaxed and then we came back and had a 5 min break while we talked to each other then 2-3 students were being called at a time",
