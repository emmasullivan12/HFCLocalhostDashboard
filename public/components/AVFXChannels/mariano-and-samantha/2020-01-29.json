But thank you so much for offering your assistance. I'm currently, studying at Coventry University BA Illustration and Animation in my final year :slightly_smiling_face: I asked if it was okay to have some assistance as for my FMP we have to get feedback from industry on our work. (Which well...there isn't much of it yet cuz I just started ^^;), if any help with that is possible that would be great!\n\nBut I also have additional questions if thats okay as is it okay to ask about your background within animation? :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThanks, Samantha",
