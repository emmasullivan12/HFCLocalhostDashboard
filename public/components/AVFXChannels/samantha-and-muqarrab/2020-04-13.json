Things have been crazy (as you can probably tell from the media :eyes:)\n\nIt definitely seems like you have smashed the work experience! I didn't have any relevant work experience until I went to university so you've got a great headstart and you've already demonstrated that you're proactive (by walking in the care home and asking straight up!)\n\nSo you said you'll likely be doing a personal statement in the coming weeks\/months. Do you know what degree\/what uni you are interested in? Also, what grades are you expecting? That way I can advise you better!",
