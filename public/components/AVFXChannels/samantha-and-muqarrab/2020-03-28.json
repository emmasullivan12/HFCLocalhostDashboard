So nice to meet you &amp; I'm really excited to be your E-Mentor :smiley:\n\nA little bit about me: I'm Samantha and I work at the NHS as part of the Royal Free NHS Hospital Trust (a group of 3 hospitals in London). The guys at Prospela sent me your profile which says you're passionate about being involved in your local community and want to get into a top UK Medical university and I can certainly give you some guidance on that and insight to work life in the industry.\n\nGreat to hear that you want to become a doctor! A GP or specific area of expertise? To what extent have you considered other roles in the healthcare industry? Would be great to know so I know what to cover during our chats :wink:",
