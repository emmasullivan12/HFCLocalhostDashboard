It is more complementary to lighting, I would say.",

A lot of people have told me it's all about who you know which is why I applied for this and got a LinkedIn to build connections and that.\n\nAlso anything visual effects fancisinates me so I'm happy to take it anywhere from games to TV to advertising.
