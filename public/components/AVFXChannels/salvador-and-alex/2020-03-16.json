I am expecting a gap work wise around end of summer\/early autumn. \n\nI think that talent is important, but being a good team member is more important. You can be the best artist in the world, if you don’t work well in a team, you won’t last. \n\nNever stop learning. Ever. Tools change. Skills change. You don’t want to get stuck with a dying software. \n\nToday, I would learn Unreal or Unity. There is a big shift towards real-time coming soon. ",
