Its an original idea, we were running out of time and it needed doing so i stepped up, the rock and hat needed to be rotoed so the drone could fly over. My friend created the drone and i tracked the footage in Nuke so my friend could animate the drone to fit in the shot, i then graded it  so the drone looked like it belonged.",
