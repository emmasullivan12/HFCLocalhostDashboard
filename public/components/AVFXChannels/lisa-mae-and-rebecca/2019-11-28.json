If you are hoping to go into VFX, replicating something from photos would make a really great piece for your showreel (I'll send you some examples). Something like a projector would work well, then you also get the added bonus of a bit of creativity with the hologram element too.",

In this project I'm responsible for modeling, texturing, shading, groom, lighting, rendering and pipeline. The shot of the baby elephant walking down the street is a WIP shot for the film (To be completed end of May 2016). Lighting on this shot was particularly challenging as there is so much integration with the plate in regards to bounce light and the lights coming from the cars. No frame's lighting is the same. It was difficult to get the fine line between making the lighting look good and getting accurate shadows. The lights were keyframed across all frames to match the cars.\n\nThe rest of the modeling projects were designed around producing accurate 3D models by modeling to photos. It was really important for me to use my own reference as I know I'll be shooting in RAW with a 5D on a fixed focal length. By using my own reference I could remove colour temperature, undistorted and align accurately to model to. Once modeling was completed I had to prep the shadows and highlights from the photos and to make tilable parts for where texture projections were impossible. I used Nuke to make tilable textures by using a Gizmo that I have created, it's essentially the same as Photoshop's 'offset' but my Gizmo uses a soft rotopaint as the mask to remove the seams. My gizmo then sharpens only the soft areas of the rotopaint, this removes the 'softness' coming into the texture. Once I projected the colour map I bring into Nuke to perform a highpass using a gizmo that I have created. It produces customization small, medium and broad filters needed for a gradated bump or displacement map.\n\nIf you have any questions about my work please don't hesitate to get in touch.",
