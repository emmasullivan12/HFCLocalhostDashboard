If they're ever in London feel free to let me know and I can tag along with you for some company. Especially in Animation it's incredibly equal- at Blue Zoo I believe it's 50\/50! It's great that you don't feel unheard, also nothing wrong with being a bit nervous\/shy. Lots of different people end up in the industry, some very outgoing and others really quite shy. Hmmm I guess the way I might go about it is after your 3d orb is 'flattened' into 2D, you could use an iDistort node and plug some animated noise into it. Hopefully these tutorials can help you out a bit- <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XnNPA5yCkxs> , <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/87174187> . It could be a nice way to add some subtle movement, it's often used for things like heat distortion. Recently I used it to move some stationary candle flames so that they looked like they're moving :smile: Once the shot gets released I'll send you a link so you can see.\n\nAhh texturing is closely related to lookdev. Lookdev has more to do with the materials and less to do with the colour\/pattern. I'm sure it'll be the next step for you in your lectures. Mari is great! We actually use Substance Painter at Blue Zoo but I know most VFX studios prefer to use Mari.\n\nYeh I was lucky enough to get hired on my graduation film display day! I had about 1\/2 months of holiday before starting here at Blue Zoo. A lot of people from good courses (like yours) will go straight into industry if they're talented. It's all about your showreel! Just keep working hard, it sounds like you are, and you'll be absolutely fine. If you ever need any feedback on your showreel let me know. Are you planning on applying for any internships? :smile:",
