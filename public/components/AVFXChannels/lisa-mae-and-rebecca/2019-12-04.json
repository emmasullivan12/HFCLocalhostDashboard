Nice to give yourself a challenge with a second asset. Are you thinking it'll be stylized or more photoreal. Oh that's exciting! Is your new brief a group project?",

And wow yeah binoculars is a great idea!! \nOur new brief is called Memory Palace and it’s about creating something abstract that tells a story of how we think about certain things. We can work in groups but we don’t have to. My two options are either being Zen or overthinking as I think coming up with concepts for these could be pretty cool!",
