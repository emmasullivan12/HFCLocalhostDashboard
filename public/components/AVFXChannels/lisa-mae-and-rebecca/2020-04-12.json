I think in general it might be hard to break into the industry at the moment (I think a lot of companies are struggling with their own staff let alone with new starters), but hopefully this should ease up as things get better in the coming months. Feel free to send your showreel over whenever it's ready :slightly_smiling_face:  That's awesome to hear, well done! It's not easy staying focused at home all the time so I'm glad to hear it's going well for you. What are your projects at the moment? Yeh work is as busy as ever here at Blue Zoo! You have to consider that they can't actually film live action plates at the moment (and for a while yet) because of the social distancing restrictions so any VFX work will dry up. However, for Animation you don't need actors or sets involved so it's a great option for companies looking to make adverts at the moment (hence Animation is actually super busy)! It might get a little rocky for VFX for a few months sadly but hopefully that means when it's all over they'll pick loads of new projects up to make up for it :smile:",
