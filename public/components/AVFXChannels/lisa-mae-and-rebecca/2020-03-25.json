I was wondering whether it would be worth it to actually send it off with everything that’s happened! Would it be alright to get some feedback on my showreel once I’ve finished putting it together?:blush:\nI’m actually really enjoying working at home because it’s really pushing me to figure things out for myself rather than just asking for help and not really learning as well as I could be! Currently got 3 projects on the go to keep me busy so this isolation hasn’t really affected me! \nGlad that hear that companies are still working during this time! As I’ve heard from my friend at DNEG that the work is starting to slim!",
