Ah things are a little hectic but we're pretty much all working remotely now which is great. Still got contact with my team (through an app called Zoom) and we catch up regularly. Starting a really wonderful new project called Pip &amp; Posy (I think BZ posted about it on LinkedIn), so working on a lot of shaders for that at the moment. I think they are hoping the internship will still run but are going to review the situation at the end of April and make a final call, fingers crossed it continues!",
