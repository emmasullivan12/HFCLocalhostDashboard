        "text": "University can be stressful around exam time, but in general it isn't at all. You get to meet new people, study a subject that (hopefully!) you enjoy, and be independent. As far as tips go, I think the most important thing is to enjoy yourself, but not too much! There is no point just going to doing nothing except study for three years - then you would miss the point of being away from home with new people and new opportunities. But obviously there is a balance. What worked for me was to find the time of day that I am most productive, and use it every day for study. So for me that was very early in the morning. So I started work at 5 or 6am, then by lunchtime had essentially finished, and used the afternoon for other things (or lectures). That balance seemed to work for me. Obviously everyone is different, so it's a question of working out what works.",

After a morning talking, the afternoon will be spent reading through documents sent from the Philippines to see if the information needed for our analysis is there.

But around 2-3 days a week I usually return home by 4:30pm due to extra Math or English classes. The problem is that because of the usually long and hectic school days i usually find myself exhausted after school. So after dinner I tend to sleep but if i have alot of workload from school i skip sleeping in the evenings and begin to finish my work instead. - This I really believe does not work for me because I just feel so tired from school that I generally just loose focus during my time doing homework. I think this may be prove to be very costly to me as I believe A-levels are extremely important hence would you advise me what i could do in a situation like this? ",
