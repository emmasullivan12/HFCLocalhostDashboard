For example I read a study which investigated whether Reading has any influence on a student in terms of their mathematical and problem solving skills. And that proved to be so. The more you read the more you get better at math and solving problems. And just like you said - the study concluded that reading allows you to be able to thing different ways giving you different prespectives to approach a problem hence students who read more perform better in their subjects than their other non-reading peers.",

When I go outside I often find myself reading things. for example - A leftover leaflet on a vacant bus seat - I would just grab it and start reading ( I often miss my bus-stop because of this habit). \n\nIf Im In a crowd or if Im In a place where I need to line up to get something I would look to see if there are any published articles or posters around me like on the walls and stuff and start reading them. \n\nHowever there are things that I read which I actually enjoy and not read them just out of habit. For example; currently Im reading 'The Great Gatsby' my english teacher reccommended it to me as it is a book where I can practice lots of analysing techniques. \n\nLike I mentioned in my introduction I also spend some of my time writing stories and then drawing the characters I've created.
