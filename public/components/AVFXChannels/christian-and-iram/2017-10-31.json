That meant I didn;t get to be at home very much, was always coming or going, and staying in different hotels etc. It can seem pretty glamorous and fun to begin with, but after a few years it gets pretty tedious, as it affects how much free time you have etc, and generally you work much longer hours when travelling abroad. At my current company I travel a lot less, which means I spend a lot more time at home, which I prefer. I also try to approach work as something that shouldn;t take priority over other aspects of life, so I leave after 8 hours even if really busy. Obviously sometimes, especially towards the end of a project, that just isn;t possible, and I end up working much longer hows, but generally I stick to my 8 hours a day, and try to enjoy life outside of work as much as possible!",
