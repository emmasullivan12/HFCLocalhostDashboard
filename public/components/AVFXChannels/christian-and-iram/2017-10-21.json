I was flying to various countries several times a week. That was a great novelty for a while - I was seeing interesting places, I had a gold card to get me access to lounges in airports... it sounds very glamorous. But it isn’t a lifestyle that is sustainable unless you are really dedicated to it. I didn’t get to be at home very much, I didn’t see friends. So it got to the point where it wasn’t for me. I have managed to get myself into a role where it isn’t like that as much now, and I am home most of the time. I still travel, but my lifestyle is much more settled now, which I prefer. But, some of my colleagues travel all of the time. So it comes down to managing it in a way that works for you.",
