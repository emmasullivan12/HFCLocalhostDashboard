I have been very lucky in my career to have had some amazing opportunities, particularly to have been at the forefront of some very large arbitrations and to have had a lot of responsibility in them. On the other hand, since I started work I have discovered philosophy by doing two part time masters, and doing reasonably well at it, so I would be interested to know how my career would have been different had I chosen to follow that academic path rather than go into consultancy and essentially do philosophy \"for fun\". At the end of the day, I guess the answer is that I am happy with where I am in life, so probably I wouldn't change anything. But it's a close call!",
