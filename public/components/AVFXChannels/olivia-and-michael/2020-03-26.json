        "text": "Here is my initial feedback on your reel - happy to answer any questions! *1st shot* -- looks good and shows that you can handle 3D integration. Showing the breakdown is helpful and the tracking\/green screen shows your process.  *2nd shot* -- with the girl, maybe include text to clarify what you did in the shot (were you responsible for the roto\/ building the background?) In the *3rd shot* with the spaceship -- can you make the text smaller to fit in the screen? The breakdown of different passes + background plate is helpful. I would suggest that you work on some personal projects to bring your reel to the next level by testing out more shots with the following aspects: CG-integration, set extensions, roto\/paint work samples, breakdown of complex passes and showing a camera projection\/matte painting background built in Nuke. Do you have a camera that you can use to capture footage to use in practice shots?",
