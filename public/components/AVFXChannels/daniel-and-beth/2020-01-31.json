I've been in the industry about 4 years now, I started off in QA at Ubisoft before I went back to University and built upon my Animation skills so I could re-enter the industry in a more creative capacity. That was about 3 years ago now, yikes how times flies!\n\nAll I'm looking to get out of this mentorship is to be of much help as I possible can to you! Getting into games is quite an intimidating and mysterious thing, so if I can do anything to de-mystify the process and help you feel more sure about what you can do to get started, I'd be very satisfied.\n\nHope that sounds good! :grinning:",
