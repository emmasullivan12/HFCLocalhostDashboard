Take an honest look at your portfolio and how you approach things. It may not be either of those things but it’s good idea to kind of start from scratch if you hit a wall. A creative cold shower. \nI’ll be happy to help out as much as I can.  \nAnyway it’s Saturday have a good weekend cheers things over. Imagine Monday is day one. \n\nCheers\n\nJez ",
