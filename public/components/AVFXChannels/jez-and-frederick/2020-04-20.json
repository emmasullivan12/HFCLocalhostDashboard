There’s enough in there to get you started if you want something to work on. If you want me to help out with notes or anything just let me know. Maybe two weeks to thumbnail it out? Then Send it over and I’ll feedback if that’s helpful? There a script in there’s that’s the launch pack I put together for the original storyboard Artist. He used a lot of it but brought a lot of great ideas to it himself. There’s an an animatic in the too from another show. <http:\/\/mbf.me\/Aek5Nq|http:\/\/mbf.me\/Aek5Nq>",
