Then there are days where you have headphones on and are deep into modeling an entire environment or texturing a large asset.\n\nWe don't really have junior artists anymore, but when we did they would help support senior artists, and we even have a mentor program so junior artists can be paired up with a more senior artist who can help show them the ropes on things here. When I was a junior artist, I never felt afraid to ask someone for help. All of the senior artists were extremely patient with me and helped me learn things when I had questions about them. Even now, as a mid level artist, I still will have questions on things and the older artists are great and share with me their knowledge still too lol You never stop learning in the job industry, which is why I signed up for this program because I feel I benefited so much when I had a mentor that I want to pay it forward as well.",
