Glad to speak to you. \nI first started off by applying on loads of different job websites and just getting a feel of the questions jobs were requiring in terms of competence. Bare in mind, some companies don’t advertise through there, just on their own website. so if you like a particular company , it would be worthwhile going on their website directly. \nAnyways, if I was invited to a interview, I knew I had a decent answer and use that as my template. Then tailor and improve the answers for each different application. \n\nI initially found this apprenticeship on Next website, but it got taken off and thus, I searched for it on LinkedIn and their it appeared. I had actually applied for this role once already a few months prior which didn’t bring back an answer, so I re-did my application on the second time and managed to get through. ",
