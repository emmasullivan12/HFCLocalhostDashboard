I believe it is mainly because it is something different to the traditional old route of higher education and some teachers believe you will miss out on the 'University life' and new experiences.\n\nI believe that University is for people who do not really know what they would want to do for their work life.\nWhere as people like me, who know what they want to and where they will reach often opt for apprenticeships.\n\nThough Universities have their own pros and cons I believe Apprenticeships also comes with many benefits which students nowadays tend to overlook or just not believe since their is very little awareness on how to go about it.
