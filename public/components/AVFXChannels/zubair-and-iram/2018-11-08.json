Mainly because I didn't know what I wanted to do so submitting a write up on a area which i was only semi-interested In wouldnt have been the best idea. \nOne thing I noticed whilst I started applying 3\/4 years ago was apprenticeships were sort of looked down upon by teachers. \nI'm surprised that notion still exists. \nI guess it won't be a harm to write up a essay (or whatever is required) as you can get it marked (sort of) and use that as a guidance for when applying for apprenticeships. As the questions will sometimes be similar- ish. ",
