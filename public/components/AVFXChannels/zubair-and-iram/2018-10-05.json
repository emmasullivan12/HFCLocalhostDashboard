My subjects meant I could go into engineering, computing or something maths related like accounting. \nSo going to uni not knowing what you wanted to become wouldn’t have been smart. \nI started off with a IT apprenticeship , completed the 18month course then decided it wasn’t for me. Worked in a factory for 2 years (much longer then I wanted to) to try to make sense of where I was going. Then managed to get this. ",
