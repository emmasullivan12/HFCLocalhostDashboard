        "text": "So looking through your CV, I think it's a VERY strong start. You have *amazing* experience for your age which so clearly demonstrates an interest in the healthcare industry, but also that you are well-rounded (i.e. doing volunteering, sports, etc)\n\nThe best thing to remember is your CV is MARKETING, not just a history of your experience. So you want to write your brand in this document!\n\nI've had a go at editing it (see attachment) with some bits highlighted in red that you should probably add...but feel free to completely ignore it. It's my opinion on what a CV should be structured like and my wording of what sounds good (I have recruited people before and never been rejected in an interview though ... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )\n\nHere's what I recommend\/have changed:\n• Removed the \"Key Skills\" section. Let's be honest, anyone can write any of these bullet points down and we wouldn't know whether to believe them. MAKE THEM BELIEVE IT by showing these examples when you talk through your work experience, volunteering, henna business etc...you certainly do have all these traits! For example, when you talk about your responsibilities at Shergills Solicitors, rather than simply saying \"answering telephones\" I've jazzed it up a bit to say \"confidently dealing with customers on the phone, including outreach to potential clients\" (or something like that). Thats a great skill to be able to demonstrate.\n• Put your most recent work experience first (and then in time order)\n• Make sure you keep formatting PERFECT i.e. the same format all the way through, words capitalised when they should be etc.\n• I moved your extra-curriculuar bits into \"skills and interests\" section and grouped each of them into headers so that it's easier to read (often people reviewing CVs wont read all the text, just the headlines!)\n• I think your Martin House volunteering can go within your work experience section as its very relevant to the career you want ... can you add any more about your responsibilities e.g. what support do you provide elderly people? Have you had any feedback from them etc?\n• Likewise I think your Pathways to Medicine Imperial programme should go right at the top of your education section! SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS GIRL! Its a great programme to be part of and looks fantastic for demonstrating the career you want (which is the whole point of the CV right! hehe)",
