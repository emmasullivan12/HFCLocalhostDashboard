So nice to meet you &amp; I'm really excited to be your E-Mentor :smiley:\nA little bit about me: I'm Samantha and I work at the NHS as part of the Royal Free NHS Hospital Trust (a group of 3 hospitals in London). Dexter sent me your profile which says your passionate about helping people and want to get into Medicine and I can certainly give you some guidance on that and insight to work life in the industry. How sure are you that you want to be a GP? To what extent have you considered other roles in the healthcare industry? Would be great to know so I know what to cover during our chats ;)\nAlso, your profile also says you're a professional henna artist which sounds fun. I love that you're slightly entrepreneurial too! Where do you do that? In my spare time I go to the gym a fair bit and cook lots!",

Ah thank you:smile: I usually do it twice a year in festivals such as eid when most people like to apply it. I can't cook:sob::sob: whenever I try I always either burn the food or burn myself:joy::joy: \n\n\nAnd no problem you can reply to me whenever you have time I do understand you're busy too, and I might be a bit late at replying too sometimes as I have sixth form so sorry in advance.",
