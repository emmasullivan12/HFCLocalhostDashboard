Although we’ve had some artistic work to complete, it’s been mostly been business oriented . Learning about how to start a business within the games\/VFX industries, and how to maintain it. Although my undergrad degree was predominantly Vfx, this year I decided to learn more about the games industry which is why I opted to work on a pc game which we are currently developing. Although I enjoy the artistic side of all I’ve learnt, I want my career to veer more into the production side. Finally I’m graduating after May . Hope this gives you a clear understanding of my situation :slightly_smiling_face:",
