What got me going was doing small projects that I had good control over. Showreel filming for actors, one minute short films, competitions and the like. There's a great YouTube channel called Film Riot that's full of advice. I'm on there every week. Cinematography is so hot right now too that if you're good at it and can show that then you'll find yourself in demand.",
