However, I've always had a love for film and cinematography, and I truly feel it would be something I could be extremely great at considering all of my film based coursework assignments were extremely enjoyable and they were the ones I received the highest marks for.\n\nWhat I need guidance on is where to start. I've been finding it a bit tricky in knowing where I could get film experience and how, because even as a runner it requires background experience that I don't have. \n\nMy first question to you is when you knew that you wanted to go into your industry what were the main steps you took to enter?",
