But I'm assuming you mean workflow?\n\nIn Features we tend to get launched on our shots by the directors first. They'll tell us the brief of what they want to see in the shot, and what acting beats they really want us to hit. Then, I'll normally either go straight into blocking, or if it's something where I feel like reference might help, I'll book some time in our reference room and film myself acting out the shot, then pick the best takes. We'll normally show blocking a couple of times before it's approved. It then goes into IP (In Progress) which is when we spline it until it's almost finished. As soon as it's nearly there and it's selling all the main acting beats, we'll get approval from Directors on IP and then it moves into Polish which is where we get to tidy up, add those little final touches that make the shot feel special and great ^^",
