All of our assessment was practical, i.e. coursework, except for the final dissertation. So we would spend the first half of each module learning about the theory of whatever topic the module was based around and then the rest of the time would be producing coursework.",

I found in my class nobody wanted to do any of the editing or after effects work, so they usually just got me to do it for them. Seemed like there weren't enough people who intended on going into post-production.",
