Definitely worth a shot, there are so many studios down here and they have hundreds of staff so even if your Uni can't find you something then you may be able to organise it yourself. If you feel like doing that, just let me know. I can give you a list of studios that I'd recommend trying to contact.\n\nMy course didn't have any placements, it wasn't a VFX specific course, more like all forms of media both traditional and digital. There was a lot of freedom in choosing what to create for assignments with loads of tutorials and workshops for specific software or techniques such as chemical photography. It was a great course though I didn't really learn anything about Film, Animation or VFX as an industry, or get any real practical experience other than what we went and sought out for ourselves.",

I might take you up on that offer though, since I only really know the massive studios.\n\nWas your course partly theory based? When I studied film last year, it was pretty much all theory, with a tiny bit of practical.",
