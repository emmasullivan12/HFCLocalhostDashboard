Though we also use Premiere Pro for short form stuff. When I was editing an animated series, everything was done in Premiere Pro. However I know other editors who work in Avid, Final Cut X and DaVinci Resolve. So there's not really any one program to learn. Which is quite nice but also annoying sometimes.",
