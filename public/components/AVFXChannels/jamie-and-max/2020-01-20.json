Fast turnarounds sound difficult, but I'm sure I could get used to it. I'd ideally work in London, but I could work elsewhere. I'm not really tied down in any way.\n\nIt'll be a while away, but is it okay if I show you some of the stuff I'm working on for criticism at some point? My class is working on this huge advert for my university, and I've got an entire section to myself that I really want to make sure looks good so I can have my first big thing on my showreel.",
