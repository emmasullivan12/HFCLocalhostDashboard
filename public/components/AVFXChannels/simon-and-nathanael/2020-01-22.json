I am continuously developing my art skills at home so I work daily such as doing the storyboards, script and learning how to do background design for the own independent animation that I'm working on for a long time. What software are you using to make the new series, Paddington Bear? What had inspired you to be an animator as I am learning to become one like you? \nHope u reply soon,\n\nNathanael Christopher",
