I then quit to finish my degree and came back a few months later now as a Paint&amp;Roto artist. I then worked 2 years at Framestore on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Thor Ragnarok etc.\nBeing in Bournemouth I saw a good opportunity to join a recent and growing company called Outpost VFX. I joined in April 2018 and have been compositing in projects like recent Watchem Series, Black Mirror, Lego ads, 22nd July etc.\nI'm also a Visiting Tutor at the Arts University Bournemouth, where I teach 2D every Saturday to first years that join the VFX course.\nI'm now excited to help you however I can, even though I am not one of those dinosaurs with decades of experience.  :slightly_smiling_face:",
