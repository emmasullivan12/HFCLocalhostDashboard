My first tip for you would be to add some noise and other small imperfections and variations into your textures. Even a little of that sort of detail can give an added level or realism. What software are you using for rendering? If using Maya and Houdini take a good look at the Arnold surface shader that is what we currently use for most surfaces. What do you use?",
