Was wondering if you could give my current progress a look if you find the time? <https:\/\/bluubat.wordpress.com\/2020\/03\/19\/wip-and-to-do-list\/|https:\/\/bluubat.wordpress.com\/2020\/03\/19\/wip-and-to-do-list\/> the password to view is memaid22 and i have time to go back and improve on\/ re-render a few shots, so dont worry about suggesting improvements for shots that are already rendered! I particularly want to work on shot 17 (00:48) to make the clown look more scared as he clings to the railing, but im struggling to make it look right! Any feedback would be hugely appreciated!",
