If you ever have anything time sensitive that you need feedback or advice on, you can email me at <mailto:kat.seale@gmail.com|kat.seale@gmail.com> and I'll get on it for you!!\n\nHonest advice on animation I can definitely do! I'll set us up a shared dropbox folder that you can drop your anim into, and I can either write up, record or do some drawovers for feedback for you ^^ Feel free to drop stuff in there whenever you like and then just shoot me a message so I know to check it!",
