I'm currently not decided as to which specific field i want to work in, but im interested in kids IP and focus mostly on 3d animation and 3d asset modelling\/texturing. I'm currently making a thesis film, which you can check out the progress of on my blog <http:\/\/bluubat.wordpress.com|bluubat.wordpress.com> where you can also find my animation and 3d modelling showreels (which are currently all 1st and 2nd year work as ive been busy with my film this year and havent gotten around to updating them!) Outside of animation, i love theatre and im currently directing a play at uni! I think id enjoy being an animation director if i stick at it for long enough, but im also considering going the 3d generalist route so im trying to keep my options open! I'd be interested to know what company you work for and what sort of projects you do!",

Are you working on your own for your thesis film or are you in a team?\n\nA little bit about me - I'm a Character Animator living and working in London. I specialize in 3D and have worked across a whole range of projects and studios for about 7 years now after graduating from the Arts University Bournemouth in 2013. My first big job was at Framestore in London working on \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" Since then I have worked at Blue Zoo, DNEG, Mikros, and Studio AKA, amongst others. Currently I'm at DNEG working on their latest Feature film, Ron's Gone Wrong, in partnership with Locksmith Animation.\n\nPerhaps to get started we can have a chat about what your goals are for our time together? Do you have any particular expectations for the mentorship?\nI'll also be very happy to chat to you about general career stuff throughout, if that's something you would like. Whether it's about what the average day looks like, what studios there are in London, applying to studios etc! I know how daunting it can be when graduation is just around the corner and you're starting to think about those next steps!",
