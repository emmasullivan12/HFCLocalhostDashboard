I may need to curb your expectations as AKA currently don't have a lot of 3d work, so I wouldn't be surprised if they are looking for a 2d artist more specifically. But it's always worth sending your work anyway, they do keep stuff on file! I remember I applied to them when I first graduated, and at the time they didn't have any openings, but then 5 years later... haha",
