There are some companies that gather CV for this among other roles (<http:\/\/www.productionswitchboardmedia.com\/home.asp>)\nOr you can check the APA website (<https:\/\/www.a-p-a.net\/jobs\/>) for ideas of what they're looking for and see if you match the skills.\nRunner is a good entry level job and again, you get to meet everyone in the studio which help building up working relationship. I had a really good experience running at Passion.\nIt's up to you really, both will take you there in the end.",
