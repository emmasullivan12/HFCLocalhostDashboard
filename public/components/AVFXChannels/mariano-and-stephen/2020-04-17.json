I had the opportunity to work on 'Rain or Shine' with Felix, such an amazing film if you havent seen it.\nI've also had the chance to producer over 100x idents with Conor for M&amp;S.\nThey are my absolute best directors at Nexus, together with FX Goby.\nIt was still a very commercially driven space so after 10 years I've decided to explore longer format, film VFX where speed is slower and the team smaller. So far I am happy with the move.",
