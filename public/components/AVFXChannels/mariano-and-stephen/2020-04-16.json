        "text": "Production for animation usually revolves around planning (both schedule and budget), crewing, creative production (assessing new briefs), running treatments for new jobs, but mostly communication - both internally within different departments in the studio and externally to Clients\/Agencies.\nPrevious to Covid19, day to day activities are run through calendar slots, either in person or via (video) calls. Now is 100% video calls or separate software like Slack, Shotgun, etc.\nThe current situation has made the production world much more difficult to overlook but nowhere near impossible. It just takes longer and we keep learning new ways to remain as efficient as possible.\nOn a separate note, I've moved on from Nexus Studios beginning of this year so I'm now working for a VFX company.",
