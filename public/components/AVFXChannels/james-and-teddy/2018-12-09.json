Most of the time they're in Photoshop painting backgrounds for our shots (it also includes a lot of photo-manipulation, like classic \"photoshopping\", where you mush different photos together to make a scene). They work on everything from the realistic to the more fantastical backdrops. It's usually \"background\" stuff in that it's far enough away not to have to build it in 3D, but that doesn't mean it's not important - often times a DMP can take up half the screen or more.",
