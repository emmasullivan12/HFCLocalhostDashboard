Is it worth the risk to address it to her when I'm not sure? I can add more detail to other productions I admire so let me know if more should be added. Let me know what amends I should make and then I'll use this as a template to write one for Jellyfish. I have also seen that DNEG and Technicolor are recruiting as well. Do you think it is worth sending a CV and cover letter to them as well?```",
