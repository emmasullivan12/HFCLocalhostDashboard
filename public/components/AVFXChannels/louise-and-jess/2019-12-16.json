I thought I’d start by telling you a bit about me,\nI went to Uni in Farnham at the University for creative Arts and studied film production as I originally thought I wanted to work on set. After uni I managed to get a job at Universal in their TV networks department, this got me into post production and after a brief stint working at Red Bee in the post production facility for channel 4 I got a job at Framestore. I worked their for 3 years as a vfx coordinator before moving to Milk VFX and working my way up to VFX producer. At Milk I worked on films like Fantasic Beasts and where to find them and TV shows like Dr Who. My work as a producer meant I was involved in project from the very start, reading scripts and organising artists to do concepts or create previz and then following the project all the way through to final vfx delivery. I’m just about to start a new role at a company called One of Us.\n\nIs VFx an area you know much about?",
