I have been making some transitions in both work and life and had let this side of things slip. It will not happen again and I really hope you are still willing to be a mentor to me. You experience of the industry sounds vast and interesting and I really would like to move into TV and film production, particularly VFX however am concerned that I never went to Uni and studied a course relating to VFX or film\/tv production. I am current a Project Manager for a digital agency and undertaking a short course at Bournemouth Uni about Adobe Premier Pro to understand film editing. I would be happy to send you a CV this evening, if you are still willing to take a look? ",
