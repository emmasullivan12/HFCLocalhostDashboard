Perhaps reference it in your cover letter and say you acknowledge they have asked for prod coord experience but as you have years experience of project management you feel you would be able to do the role and learn the vfx pipeline quickly. Something like that. There is a shortage of production staff so they should be open to applicants from outside vfx",
