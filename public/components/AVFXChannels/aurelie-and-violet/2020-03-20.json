Then Double Negative team was going to come to our school and a few of us would be selected for interviews, so I worked veryyyy hard and a lot to get my reel ready in time and got an interview with them.\nThen they liked my profile, so I had another interview and they took me for the 2D runner position where I did a training in roto and prep.\nSo my plan was basically just to make it to a very low entry level position inside a big vfx company to have my foot in the door as I didn't have any comp work to show from school :)\n\nThat sounds awesome ! Can you show me a screenshot of it so that I can understand the shot better ? It's hard to picture it in my head ^^\nFor the depth, the best would be to have a Z depth pass but I'm not sure it's possible in After Effects. Then I would play with the color correct ( offset, gain, gamma...) to fake some depth in Nuke.\nOut of the box like this I'd say that LumaKey would work but again without seeing the shot is quite hard to advice :slightly_smiling_face:",
