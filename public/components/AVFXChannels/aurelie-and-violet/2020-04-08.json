I don't know if I have already mentioned it, but my school is a little different from others, in the sense that it is more fast paced. Instead of taking multiple classes over the course of a semester, we have 1-2 classes a month. So for this month, I got inspired by a project from an artist I met last month. He basically did a matte painting of a castle on a hill, and then comped some other elements into it. I'll share a link to his reel. The project I got inspired by is the very first one. <https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artwork\/8lWavw>",

I'm showcasing a variety of skills such as keying, rotoscoping, projections, tracking, CG integration and color grading. Most of the work was realised in Nuke, also some matte painting was done in Photoshop and I also used some renders from Maya and Vray. Creating this reel was really challenging and I learned a lot from the whole process. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed doing it.",
