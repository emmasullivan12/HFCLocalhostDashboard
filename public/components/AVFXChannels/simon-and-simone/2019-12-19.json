From what I’ve seen and heard it sounds like a place where everyone is trying hard to do good work, but without having the extreme competitiveness or super long work hours. It’s also rare to hear the voice of an “insider” for us students, I think, so there is also some curiosity. I have been hoping I would be able to get a job somewhere in England as well, so that I can stay in the country, and BlueZoo seems like a nice option if it’s possible for me.\n\nThe short film program sounds great as well, by the way, do a lot of people grab the opportunity? I think it’s really nice that everyone gets to pitch. \nI have seen some of the recent ones (the Idea, Ada, Mamoon, Via, etc), I’m not sure if one of these is the most recent. I think they’re all really nice, though, I like how every short is trying to do something new and exciting, it’s very inspiring. I can imagine it must be fun to work together with all kinds of artists, where everyone has fun and interesting ideas to add to the projects (kind of like uni but more?)\nDo you get time during work hours to learn new stuff as well? The prospect of being able to continue learning new skills while working is quite nice ",
