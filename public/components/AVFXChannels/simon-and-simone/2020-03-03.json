The more you animate the better you become obviously so you'll stop making old mistakes but there's always something new to learn, and I think that's where it's still common to wonder why something doesn't look right. If I have days where I feel like I'm not learning something new or just \"phoning it in\" that reminds me to push myself out of my comfort zone again.\n\nI guess my process would be a mental checklist like:\n- Are the key poses as strong and clear as possible?\n- Are the acting choices efficent enough to get the shot done on time?\n- Are the breakdowns between as interesting as they can be?\n- Do all actions have an anticipation\n- Settling after a movement. Does it ease into a stop or overshoot and come back?\n- If you're relying on offsetting keys to get overlap, go back through the keys and get as much overlap in the poses as possible first.\n- Make sure you're adding in the facial animation as you add keys.\n\nSpeaking of the face. To maintain connectivity always treat the face the same way you should treat the body - Like one connected object. So in the same way you should animate the body from pose to pose, do the same with the face. When you're posing the body also pose the face, including whatever mouth shape should be there for the lipsync.\n\nI often see juniors leave facial animation to the last minute because they spend all their time getting the body looking nice then just slap on some lipsync and blinks. The face is where the audience looks most of the time! Here's an example I did on Tree Fu Tom, see how everything including the face is there at the stepped stage?",
