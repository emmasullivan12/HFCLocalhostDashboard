As a company they really value their staff and are always looking to do the best they can do with the resources they have. Depending on the project you often get a lot of freedom too. The other thing I love is there's a culture of sharing information, everyone wants to keep learning, which is the mindset you need in this industry! They also allow ideas to come from anywhere, you may have seen our latest short film? That was directed by a lady who is part of our HR department and we had another short done a few years ago by a very junior storyboard artist. Was there anything specific you wanted to know about working at bluezoo?",
