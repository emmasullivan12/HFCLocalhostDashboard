I'd recommend doing lots of quick exercises that are very specific eg taking one step, a jump, a head turn, one very specific technique you want to do. Don't spend too long on them and treat them as disposable, not something to polish for the demoreel, you'll learn loads that way. Obviously still do your main pieces of work but we find here that people who drill themselves in lots of short sharp exercises improve much faster.",
