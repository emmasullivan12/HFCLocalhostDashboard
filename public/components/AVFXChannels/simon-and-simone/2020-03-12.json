I like how dynamic it is even when he moves mostly within his pose.\nIf you're blocking mouth poses, do you sometimes run into issues with matching the lip sync to the poses you have already created?\nIf you're really tight on time with a shot, are there any parts of the checklist that you're more willing to \"sacrifice\"? (Although I suppose with so much experience, it's probably possible to avoid working until the last minute?)\n\nOn a side note, I finished the little scene with the robot that I did for the BlueZoo project at our university a few weeks ago (it has been quite a while). Since I got so much feedback from some of the animators that came down to our uni, I was afraid that I wouldn't have had time to do any more changes if I asked for your feedback, which is why I haven't sent it over so far. I would like to polish the animation for showreel purposes now after the deadline, though, so I'd be very happy if you wouldn't mind taking a look and giving me some suggestions for what I could improve?\n\nDo you sometimes animate outside of work as well? It seems some people are quite active when it comes to passion projects, while others stick more to it as a 9-5 job, so I was just a bit curious.\nHope you and your family are safe from the virus.\n\nCheers, Simone",
