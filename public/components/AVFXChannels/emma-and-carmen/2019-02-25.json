The only sort of 3D work I've done is plastercine animation, I've not done any digital work but I'd like to try it.\n\nThat's really interesting, I think I got into animation like that too, I used to draw a lot as well. What sort of work do you do at your job?\nMy portfolio is coming along OK, it's actually really come together in the past few weeks. I go to this class at Edinburgh Collage of Art called ACES, and there I've been given advice and help with putting it together. Edinburgh Collage called me in for an interview for the 11th of February, in the holidays, and I wasn't expecting an interview so quickly after I applied (they had only given me a few days notice), I was thinking I'd have until April to prepare my portfolio. Luckily there was an option to request to rearrange the time, as I had barely got anything close to a proper portfolio ready. ACES have been in contact with Edinburgh Collage who are saying that if I don't get an email to have the interview in February, it'll happen in April. Which is great. I'm still waiting for the email but it should come today. These past few weeks have been really busy but I've gotten a lot done, quite a lot of my work has been mounted, and I'm finishing off my sketchbooks too. I'm so happy to have an extra month or so. ",
