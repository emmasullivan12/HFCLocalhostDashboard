Work has been very busy but I will definitely be around a lot more from now :slightly_smiling_face: That's brilliant, are you more interested in 2D or 3D Animation at the moment? I also love that feeling of everything being put together as you really see the result of hard work put into all the different little bits.\n\nAs for how I got into animation - I always loved animated films but I didn't do any or know that I wanted to pursue it until I was in my arts foundation year after secondary school. I grew up drawing a lot though so animation felt like an amazing medium to learn. I started off working on some quite fine art-y rotoscoping animation and then experimented more with 2D for a little bit before I went to the Uni of Hertfordshire to study it as a degree. That's where I learnt all about making short films and getting the skills necessary to not just be an animator but to also be able to contribute well within a team! I built my showreel over those three years and then applied to a crazy amount of studios haha, finally got a reply about 6 months after graduation and it's been quite okay for work since then",
