A great resource for is Aaron Blaise's youtube channel, he does quite a lot of livestreams where he demonstrates his animation process - can pick up some great tips along the way\nAt work I'm mostly working on quite short term medical animation projects which means a LOT of variety haha - as I'm in a small studio though sometimes I'm required to jump in to rigging or any other generalist tasks if other specialised members of the team are already busy on other jobs (as we're usually balancing around 2 - 3 projects at the same time). Previously I've worked in studios (Jellyfish Pictures, DNEG) where I would only animate. It's quite fun getting to try new things all the time!\n\nThat's great your portfolio is coming together! If you ever want to show me work\/ask me tips about anything in particular I'll help as much as I can! Will be great to hear how the interview goes, you sounds quite prepared which will count for a lot",
