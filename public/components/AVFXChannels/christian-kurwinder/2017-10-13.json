Once I have spoken to her I will let you know what she says. Of course, a degree can help you in more than just the specific focus of the degree - I have never used any of my degree in my job. So for making a difference with a criminology degree, one option might be a think tank or charity. IPPR, Amnesty etc might be worth thinking about.",
