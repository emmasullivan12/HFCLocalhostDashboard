And I’m planning to turn that into a rigging UI for myself.\n\nThe other is a stretch leg script that takes inputs from the user and sets up nodes to allow the joints to scale.\n\nI’m kinda comfortable with coding but would like to gain more confidence I often find myself going the long way round because that’s how I comprehend the process.
