I'm putting together a showreel but it won't be ready until the end of August. I would happy to do some interning or shadow other designers. I am leaving my current job next week so that I can focus my energy into improving my skills.\n\n I'm speaking to lots of people for advice on how to get started and what it is like to freelance.\n\n:)",
