Or another way is to apply as a runner. Showreel shouldn’t be longer than 3mins and should show your best work. Once done you can show it to me and I can give feedback. But make sure it starts with your best work.",

Would you suggest going for a bigger studio first or looking for a smaller studio to apply for? \n\nOkay perfect thank you :) when I get my showreel ready I'll show it to you. \n\nYeah I have a LinkedIn page but I feel like I need to branch out more. Try and talk to more recruiters. \n\nOkay thank you for all the advise :) I have two more questions for now if that's okay? \n\nHow long does it take to progress in industry? \n\nWhat are the opportunities like to work in other countries   (America, Canada, etc.)",

You just need to step in, doesn’t matter small or big studio. \nTo progress into the industry , it really depends on the individual. Some people progress after and some take their time. You just really have to be very passionate, learn fast and that way you can move up fast. Attitude and work ethics are the most important. Gaining that respect and trust , leads and supervisors will trust you with more challenging work.\nAnd yes vfx is one of the best industries where you are be able to work abroad and travel around. For example I work for Dneg and we have studios in LA and Canada , I know people who have asked for transfer. I know friends who have gone to Tokyo and Australia. ILM just opened a studio there.",
