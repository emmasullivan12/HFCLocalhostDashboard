        "text": "Hi Viktor,\nthank for all the information,\n\nI felt like you jump a bit too early for uvs and texturing, but that maybe depend on where you plan to texture and render.\n\nFor a game engine your modelling is on an Ok level, for realist render on any raytracer I believe you won't have enough info\/modelling detail.\n\nThere's some gotcha's on your currentl model that will not deliver a realistic result at the end.\n- all your pavement and roads, are very simplist in terms of model , I would bevel and pay more attention to your phot references\n- your close up main objects the chariot , the piano, the wood barrel carrier, all are low poly,\nthis may cause you issue if you go to close on them\nThe tram is quite good, just be careful not to go to close.\n\nAll the environment are pretty good, just believe you just have too much work in front of you.\nToo many scenes, all of them very challenging, but if you keep putting the same effort you will succeeded. \n\nLet me know how are you planning to render the sequences, game engine or on raytracer.\n\nTexturing needs good model to bounce of and shine ,so be carefull with sharp edges .\n\nYour uving process will also need to be consist of how are you rendering.\n\nQuestion: what are you doing with your character ? Do you need to animate it ? \n\nYou are doing great,specially as this is all by yourself. \nIf we had this project I would get a team of 2 to 3 artist and give them 3 months of full time work to achieve photo real.\n\nLet me know your thoughts ,\n\nThank you , keep it up\n\nJohnny",

It's an ongoing issue with me because I keep contemplating if I should include him in my scenes or just leave him for my showreel as a separate asset. I can see how my scenes look too simple and will work towards adding more detail to them.\n\nJust wondering. When you look at showreel sent to you. What specific things do you look for in them? \n\nI'm just worried that because I'm coming from a animation background, I lack the experience in the vfx field.",
