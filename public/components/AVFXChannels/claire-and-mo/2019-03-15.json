We're in the process of fine tuning an animation pipeline, as the studio was primarily a visualisation company until last year, specialising in stills or procedural movement. Meaning lots of gap finding and filling, which is fun, but busy times. \n\nHow are you doing?\n\n'I have a question, what steps did you take to find a job in the industry after Uni ? anything you recommend me do ?'\nI applied for work experience mostly, internships were around at the time, but not a much as they are now (and that was only 4 years ago!). I would highly recommend getting in contact with potential companies, find their recruiters on LinkedIn, and ask about internship\/work experience opportunities :)\nI had three lots of direct animation industry work experience opportunities prior to leaving university, and I had experience mentoring as part of an animation workshop for two years in a row.
