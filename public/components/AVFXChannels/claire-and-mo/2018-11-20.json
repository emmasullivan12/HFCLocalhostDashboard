Feel free to just reply 'I'm not sure', to any of the questions, or simply no answer, it'll just give me a better overview of how to help you. Also if I do not make sense at any point, please tell me so I can re-word it, also new keyboard lately, so getting used to that too!\nSo I saw on your profile that you want to own your own animation company after working in the industry several years, which sounds great, I wanted to mentor you because I know a few people who have done this, so figured I could ask them questions if you wanted.\n\nYou specified in your profile about animation and previs, I would like to double check if this is for CG or 2D animation? No problem either way, this is just so I know what you are aiming for.\nAlso do you have any companies in mind that you would like to work with, so the reels you make are aimed at them?\n\nAlso feel free to ask me questions! It is what I am here for after all.\nHope you are having a fantastic day :slightly_smiling_face:",
