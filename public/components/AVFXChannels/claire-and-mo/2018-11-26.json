        "text": "Hey Mo, apologies for the delay! I have been looking into it all.\nSo the company director here stems from that kind of background. He's more of a modeller than an animator, but he had several years working freelance for companies and gained contacts before striking out on his own. I can get more of a story from him if you would like.\nI know in some situations they made companies out of necessity, as they could not move to the job, and achieved success by finding gaps in the market.\n\nSo I had a quick look at third floor's applications for previs animators, and this is their recommendations:\n\"-Possesses a strong sense of composition, color, animation timing, and storytelling\n-Animates a wide variety of subject matter from vehicles to small objects, to realistic character performances, all with a strong sense of camera animation\n-Uses lights efficiently\n-Has good knowledge of cinematic language, camera terminology and the ability to use motion blur, depth of field and other effects, to create realism\n-Has the ability to clean up &amp; accentuate mocap animation\nIs team oriented and able to successfully take direction from a supervisor\n-Is adaptable, flexible and accepting of change, often tossing out ideas and starting anew\"\n\n<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CHdzXECbH4w> this is one of their latest reels.\n\nHave you heard of flooby nooby? While most of his posts, like this one <http:\/\/www.floobynooby.com\/comp1.html> , talk about 2D aspects of cinematography, there are also posts about CG, like this post <http:\/\/floobynooby.blogspot.com\/2013\/12\/the-cinematography-of-incredibles-part-1.html> which I find incredibly insightful for constructing a shot.\n\nTo be honest, most of the people I know who went into previs, were recommended into the position by people they knew. Which does tend to happen within the animation industry. I shall keep an eye out for any recruitment drives for you to make more of those contacts.\n\nI also highly recommend you find demo reels from people who are working in companies like 'the third floor' and see what kind of showreels they were applying with.",
