There is also a lot of empty space on his one.  Just for information the judges preferred the look of this animatic.\n\n-           At the start of the film when the boy is playing his game, the judges thought it would be better if the boy was not angry\/frustrated.  He should perhaps be more bored (‘zombie’ ) like.  The back ground noise of the game could be more monotonous ‘bloop’ ‘bloop’ sounds.\n\n-           It was also felt that with the room in darkness and then the sound of the cockerel, it appeared the boy has been up all night playing games which he is probably too young to be doing.  With this in mind it would be better to have some natural light in the room and then the boy hearing a loud braying donkey instead of a cockerel which makes him look up and out of the window.\n\n-           The camera shot going through the window needs to be slicker and a bit longer.  At the moment the camera goes forward then back on itself really quickly.  Maybe consider a cut in here.\n\n-           You need to get to the end frame with all the characters in a much smoother way.",
