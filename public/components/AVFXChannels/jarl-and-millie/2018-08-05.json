It honestly seems like a somewhat depressing spin on Winnie the Pooh, but in reality the story is not depressing at all, and the stuffed animal designs are really cute (we had real costume versions of them from Disney as reference and everyone wanted to steal them haha, Eeyore was particularly cute).",
