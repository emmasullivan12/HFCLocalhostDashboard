Honestly I have no idea if that is actually something you would enjoy, it might be a bit too fully into VFX than you are necessarily interested in at this stage (and I honestly don't know how often companies do hire runners without any background related to VFX, although at least one of them says on their website that prior knowledge is good but not required). The main reason I mention that is because I do have more knowledge of these kinds of companies, which would allow me to potentially help you find some, and also at your age I think it could be a really nice way to get a clearer sense of what it's like at these kinds of studios, allowing you to know more about what jobs at these companies involve before committing to any related education\/training",
