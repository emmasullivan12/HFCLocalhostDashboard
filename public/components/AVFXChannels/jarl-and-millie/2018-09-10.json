I think I'm going to pursue photography. :grin: I really enjoy it and I think I have the eye for it so I'm going to ask a family friend who runs their own photography business as to how to get into the industry and if I can work with them for a while. \nI like the idea of submitting my work to somewhere like the magazine you recommended but because I shoot a lot of nature I was wondering if you had any ideas if submitting photos to places like natgeo wild (maybe not that high profile but you get the idea :sweat_smile:) I was thinking of selling y2k photos to a national trust board or something? Any thoughts? Hope you're doing well!",
