It sounds really interesting I can't wait to see it! \n\nThanks for the advice, I've been struggling with making an account because I'm double guessing everything :sweat_smile: I agree with you in that this isn't going to be a huge source of income, but I have been getting in contact with professional  photographers and they have said that the main money is working off of requested commissions like weddings or albums. I'm definitely going to reach out to artist for advice, I hadn't tried that before. And thanks for the YouTube tutorial, I think I've watched it already but I'll give it another watch. Hope everything's coming along with you. ",
