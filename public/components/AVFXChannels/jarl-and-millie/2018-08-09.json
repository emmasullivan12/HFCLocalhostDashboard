I was mentioning cover letters because I myself was not writing cover letters for any jobs when I was younger. I just had a \"resume\" (as people in the States call it). It is also not unheard of that there are sometimes people finishing from university, or even from graduate school, who are applying for VFX jobs with zero prior job experience. And here you are before Uni and already with prior job experience :) You seem like a great candidate for these jobs! I hope the interviews go well.",
