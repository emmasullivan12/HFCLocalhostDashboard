I think her company is focused on teaching younger teenaged girls software development\/coding skills through the subject of video\/time based image processing. After her undergraduate degree, I believe she previously worked for this big name commercial photographer as a studio assistant, and as I understood it I think since she was not as personally interested in commercial photography, so she pursued further education to get into a separate field, but then found another area of interest (video and programming) which was probably heavily supported by her photography background. I imagine for her it felt necessary to pursue more education in order to make that switch, and although it might not have been a requirement for her to go back for more education in order to start that company, I think she got exposed to that opportunity as a result of going back for her masters, and the education she received from that masters degree probably really supports the focus of video\/graphics programming at her company Vid Code.",
