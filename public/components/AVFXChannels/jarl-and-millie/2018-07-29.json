It's reassuring to hear that you weren't entirely sure as to what to do until after you were expected to, as I'm the same. \n\nMy mum was a graphic designer so she has always encouraged me and my siblings to be expressive, all three of us (me, my older brother and sister) took art through GCSE and A level. \nI particularly enjoy photography as an art form, I try to take as many untouched photos as I can to challenge myself but I have a few edited photos as well. I'm actually trying to compile a portfolio and was wondering if you had any tips? \n\nI wasn't expecting to find someone in the film industry as a mentor so I'm extremely excited! I have done acting alongside art since primary school. I particularly enjoyed doing West end summer school because I got to perform on her majesty's stage which was amazing. I did that for 4 years but I couldn't afford to continue. I think that's what inspired me to take it at college, because I was so upset I couldn't act anymore I decided to take it at A-level. I've kind of hit a wall with that though, as I'm upset I'm not doing it anymore again but this time I'm struggling to find somewhere I can go to continue working in theatre. \n\nI'm very creative but I'm not very academic which is why I turned away from Uni (not definitively, I may go later in life) \n \nHope you're well!",
