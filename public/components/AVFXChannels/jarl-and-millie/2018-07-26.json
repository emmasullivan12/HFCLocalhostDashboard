I think a big part of my getting the chance to work on Gravity had to do with working hard at getting my skills in a strong enough place to be able to create a solid portfolio, which for computer animation involves putting together a 'reel'\/short video exhibiting your work. I'll send you a link to my reel that got me that job (it's outdated now, but still I figure it might be interesting to see). Another thing that I think made getting that first job possible was building a solid relationship with one of my Uni lecturers, who had worked at DreamWorks Animation. He knew loads of people in the industry, and he was the one who put me in touch with the guy who hired me to work on Gravity.",
