Thanks for looking at my photos! :grin: I actually did a charity trek in Borneo, after we built schools and homes in different villages we did a week long trek through the bornean rain forest where we saw wild orangutans and loads more, (although the red panda was the isle of white zoo :sweat_smile::sweat_smile:) thank you so much for your offer, but I don't think I would be much good at a VFX job just yet :sweat_smile: I do play around with light in my pictures quite a lot, I love taking macro photos but the lenses on my camera can't quite support it properly (:sob:) \nMy interviews went really well! I applied to work retail for now just to earn some money and I got an interview for a vape shop and they offered me the job on the spot! :grin: I'm just waiting for them to send me my start date :grin:",
