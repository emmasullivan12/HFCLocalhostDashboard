I have a few friends\/acquaintances who are working professional photographers, who although they are in the States, I've been thinking of reaching out to them to see if they have any advice or interest in chatting directly with you. Would that interest you at all at this point?\n\nOn the topic of my work, there is a Women in VFX union meeting coming up in a few weeks that I thought was worth mentioning. \n\n<https:\/\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\/e\/women-in-vfx-2018-tickets-49951754041?ref=eios&amp;aff=eios>\n\nAs is the case with pretty much every industry, we also have a huge gap in the number of Women in VFX, leadership roles and I am sure pay gaps as well. I think the focus for this meeting is in celebration of the women that are in VFX, but certainly also predicated on the fact that there aren't enough women and that they experience significant disadvantages.\n\nI hope you are having a good week :)",

Last year we've spoken outloud about sexism and inequality. But not all is bad. This year we are here to celebrate the presence of women and their success in the VFX industry. We are aiming to bring together women in our industry to share experiences and ideas. Your story. Our story.",
