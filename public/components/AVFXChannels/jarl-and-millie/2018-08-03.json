I watched a WIP screening earlier today of the film I'm working on right now, which the start was as delayed during lunch\n\nI'vey watched 2 or 3 episodes of Handmaid's Tale myself, but what I saw I thought was pretty well done.\n\nI used to enjoy this photography magazine made where I am originally from in the U.S. called \"Shots\", which featured photography from all kinds of people. It was basically submission based, so I think anyone could get their photos in it if they sent them in and were selected. \n\n<https:\/\/shotsmag.com>\n\nOn the topic of analogue photography, have you ever developed your own film? I always wanted to try that, it's seems like such a nice thing to do, playing with light and really crafting the final image. \n\nDo you have any particular photographers or photography magazines you really like?\n\nThis looks pretty cool!\n<https:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/whats-on\/tate-modern\/exhibition\/shape-light>\n",
