You have good sense of strong silhouette in many of your photos, like the aptly named \"Silhouette flowers\", but also in some of the more subtle ones like the overhanging leaves in \"raging waters\" and trees in \"Carisbrooke castle (I love the light in that one too).Strong silhouette is a really important concept for animation :slightly_smiling_face: Your animal photos are great too!
