I studied 3D animation at Vancouver Film School in Canada, where I made my first short.\nAnd although I have some experience I still have a lot to learn too! I think it's important you know that I can only share my perspective on things, and I might not know all the answers, but I'll definitely try the best I can!\nSo please feel free to ask me about anything you have doubts on, or want answers to\nIf you'd like, tell me a about yourself too, it would be great to see any work\/ projects you've done, I read on the thing that you draw?",
