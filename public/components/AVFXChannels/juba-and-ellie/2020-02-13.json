The movement look so realistic, even on very cartoon-y rigs. It’s absolutely amazing! What beings\/objects do you enjoy animating the most?\n\nIt’s been really tough, but I think the lectures are doing a good job of covering the basic stuff this semester, so I’m hoping to be able to focus on more artsy stuff in my second year. I’ve found that I really love modelling, although I do find UVing and texturing very difficult, so I really need to work on that more in order to make complete looking assets. I’m using maya mostly, with bits of zBrush for any organic models.\n\nI would also like to ask your advice on what methods you use to manage your time effectively, as I really struggle with organisation and meeting deadlines. I know it’s a very broad question, but any of your input as someone who has both studied animation at university and worked in the industry would be helpful to me.",
