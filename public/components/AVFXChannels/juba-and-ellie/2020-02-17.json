Learning how different things move and finding ways to bring them to life is part of why I love animation.\nAnd about UV's and texturing, It's great to be aware of your weaknesses\/ what you find difficult, it becomes more straight forward to practice and improve on it.\n\nSo for time management, it's a tricky question. Throughout the week I can have relaxed deadlines and suddenly get a super short one, so I have to adapt depending on the situation.\nFirstly I try and prioritize whats most important, I write down bullet points\/ checklist of what I need to do, If I see the time isn't enough I immediately flag it to production so they're aware, and find out if I have wiggle room :smiley:\nWhen I was in Uni, I had we had to work on a solo short-film, since I needed to make everything, the most important part was to set realistic goals.\nAfter splitting up my work between hard, medium and easy shots, I could get an idea of how much time a shot would take to animate. So in the beginning of the day, I'd set a goal of what I needed to get done, and I'd try my best to meet it. It was super important to be aware of my capability\/ speed, and the more I did it the more I'd know how long something would take.\nDoes that help in anyway?",
