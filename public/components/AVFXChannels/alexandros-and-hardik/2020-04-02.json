For that, I even made a word document where I explained all the races and their cultures. I then made a table of purchasable weapons the player could buy  with durability, damage, cost, selling cost and minimum level to wield it. It's set in a middle earth like world where they use weapons that were used before gunpowder was an aspect in warfare. It's definitely something that will take a long amount of time and commitment.",
