I like that we have to make use of some of the code they give us because it sometimes speed things up and you can learn shortcuts. I've also spent a bit of time adding a bit more information to the game I talked about and found an engine called Love, I found it after finding out about the community game that was made real from the show. It's an 8 bit engine I think and I think I will use that.",
