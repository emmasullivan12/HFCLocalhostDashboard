But in the summer, I tried to make my own RPG but entirely text based. I think I gave up on it because, I discovered what you could do with OOP but I still need to learn a lot. I've stopped focusing on python since then I guess so I could focus on coursework I have. I've also decided to do my computer science coursework in Visual Basic, since its something I am comfortable with and suits the task I'm doing.\nCould I ask how you knew all of the things you mentioned about me? I think I get the league one but python wow!",

I think if I had come to London maybe I would have found it more difficult. Obviously I was very lucky to be able to do so.\n\nI think it's also important to keep in mind that university is not necessary for a career as a programmer (though I found it useful and interesting). Do you think you'd be interested in studying at university or more on picking up key skills?\n\nFilm making was always driven by technology, and now that means software: a lot of work doesn't happen in front of a camera anymore! There's big studios, like DNEG, who work on post-production and visual effects. Then there's pure software companies that write software for film making e.g. The Foundry is a very successful UK company that sells their software throughout the world!\n\nI would argue that there are universities and companies that try to tackle big, important problems. Unfortunately, they might not get as much publicity as other things like silly apps. :slightly_smiling_face: For me climate change is an important problem.
