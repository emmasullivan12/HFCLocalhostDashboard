I am so sorry for the very long delay in getting back to you - work was so crazy before xmas and I was away for 2 (glorious!) weeks for Christmas and New Years,\n\nI was really clear with Dexter when I signed up to be a mentor here that I have very limited 3D experience. When we were paired together, I was assured that you only wanted general information on the industry. I really respect that you want more than that, but I am not the person to be able to give you the tutoring you want. I really want you to get the most out of your mentorship and I am sad that I don't have the knowledge you need. So leave it with me and I will try and get you a new mentor here.\n\nI will be in touch as soon as I know anything. In the meantime, check out Animdojo if you can, as you get 1:1 tutoring from the Blue Zoo 3d department with that.\n\nChat soon,",
