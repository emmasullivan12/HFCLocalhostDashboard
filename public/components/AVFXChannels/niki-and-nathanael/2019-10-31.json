I am a year 10 student and keen to pursue Animation as my profession. I like to write stories for my character design independently. I have always enjoyed animated films from an early age watching classics at home such as Tom &amp; Jerry and The Snowman. More recently I really admire the work of Seth MacFarlane's Family guy and \nAmerican Dad.\n\nI have created characters, posters and short stories that I hope to one day animate.\n\nAt the moment, I am learning to how to use 3DS Max as well as my brand new graphics tablet. \n\nWhat advise could you give me about routes into animation e.g. Colleges or Universities? \nIf possible could you advise me on other opportunities for animation courses or events like VFX.\nAlso, can you work on an animation project independently? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you. \n\nKind regards, \n\nNathanael",
