While I've mostly worked in 2D, I did work with Giant Creative on a short film they made for Cartoon Saloon.  And I studied at Animation Mentor, which is an online 3D animation school! That one is done through Maya though, and not Max.\n\nThere are multiple ways into animation. Really it depends on what kind of person you are. I did a BA Hons Degree in Animation, so I did the college route. There are a few with really good reputations in the UK, though Bournemouth stands out as being the best. Or you could start as a runner\/intern\/apprenticeship in a studio and try work your way up and learn on the job. The biggest issue with the internship route is that most aren't paid and you might have to do a few before you are hired for a paid role. Apprenticeships don't come around that often as far as I know.Having a strong body of work will be what helps you get anywhere in animation.\nSo keep doing what you are doing. Keep learning. I would recommend looking at things like the 11 Second Club : <http:\/\/www.11secondclub.com\/> It's great because they have sound clips, rigs, props etc. All you have to do is download them and animate! You need some Max\/Maya knowledge to set up your shots, but it's a great way to start.",
