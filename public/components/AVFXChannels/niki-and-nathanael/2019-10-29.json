It's very exciting that you want to get into animation. I taught the 2D animation section of VFX Summer School, so maybe I met you at that?\n\nCan you tell me a little bit more about yourself? What made you decide you want to work in animation? For me it was classic Disney movies, which is probably why I love 2D so much!\nHow do you find 3DS Max and Blender? Are you still learning or have you been able to do some little animations yet? How are you finding the graphics tablet? It took me a while to get used to it when I got mine first!\nAnd I'd love to know if there is anything specific that you would like my help with? I'm really excited to be able to help you, but I want to make sure that we are on the same page so you get the most out of this ^^,\n\nChat soon,",
