I hope this link would help me on my project because I've been trying at different softwares but most of them doesn't work or seem very useful. Also, I am looking to do an apprenticeship at a animation company. If possible, could you please send me the short film you were involved in. \n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nRegards,\nNathanael Christopher",
