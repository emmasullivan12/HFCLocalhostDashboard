My university course is finishing up now so I'm likely going to have plenty of time to practice and get my footing with it. Your ideas were really helpful- I like the idea of starting with paper cut outs! I've been looking vaguely at jobs but life is kind of on hold at the moment so I'm not particularly worrying about it right now. How do you find moving around for jobs (you don't have to share if you don't want!) Going to keep working at it.",
