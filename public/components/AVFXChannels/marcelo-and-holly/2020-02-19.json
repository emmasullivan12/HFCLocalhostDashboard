I already know what shots I have to do for the week - I have around 1m45s to animate in 3 weeks, 1 and a half week for keyframes and the other 1 and a half to fix and in-between everything. At the start of those 3 weeks we have a briefing meeting where we watch the episode animatic with the director and animation director and take notes on anything specific for our shots. After that I just have to pay attention to the dialogue, animatic, any additional notes and animate it all hehe\nWhen I'm done with keyframes the team lead will usually draw over my shots and give me notes on what to fix\/improve, then I in-between the shots and in the end I have another round of review from lead and animation director. Many weeks ahead we get retakes from nickelodeon and have to do them while we are dealing with the current episode.",
