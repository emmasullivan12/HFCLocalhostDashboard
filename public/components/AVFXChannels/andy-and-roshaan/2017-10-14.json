What intrigued me the most was researching and developing new products and then of course Teaching. I think for now, I really want to work in Research and Teaching. Do you whether these two options are well payed and satisfying as a job?\n\nOther than that, I think working in a company like NHS can be interesting. I am not doing chemistry as an a level so my chances of working as a doctor or in a Hospital are low. If I continue with a Biology degree, are there any chances of me becoming a doctor? \n",
