In terms of job satisfaction, I don't do a research job so I can't speak from experience - but I have found a couple of websites that will hopefully give you an insight...one of them includes a free quiz to see if it thinks your personality is one that might enjoy a job in research. \n\nYou can do a conversion course to go from Biology to medicine (see link) but it will take more time, which also means more money. I know of a few people who have done it, but the main route is to go directly into medicine. \n\nWhat other A-levels are you doing?\n\n<http:\/\/study.com\/articles\/Biological_Scientist_Job_Description_Salary_and_Outlook.html>\n\n<https:\/\/www.sokanu.com\/careers\/biologist\/salary\/>\n\n<https:\/\/www.prospects.ac.uk\/postgraduate-study\/conversion-courses>",
