It's all good. university is university - the experience is pretty similar everywhere.\n\nI didn't work hard enough in my last year of uni so didn't end up going to the university I wanted, but I still had a good time at university. Worked hard, and got an training contract with an accounting firm when I left.\n\nI didn't regret where I went to university, only that I didn't work hard enough to get to the best possible university that I could. So my advice would be not to stress about where at university, but to focus on getting the best grades possible because that will give you the most options. \n",
