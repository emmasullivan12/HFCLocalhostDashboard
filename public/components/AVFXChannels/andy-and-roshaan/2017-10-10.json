It is quite interesting as it let's me make connection with real life scenarios to what I learn in Biology. In terms of careers, I can only see two that are related to Biology. Research and Teaching. Other than this I don't know much about Biology as a career. ",

Hope you find it helpful.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about Biology? It's a pretty broad subject, and answering that might help you narrow your focus.\n\nAlso worth noting that Biology is a reputable degree. Your options won't just be restricted to research and teaching. When I started my accountancy training contract, the firm hired people from many different backgrounds...not just finance and economics. The same will be true for other firms.\n\nMy work hours can be pretty unpredictable (often finish late) so can't promise a time, but if you message me, I will do my best to get back to you within a day!",
