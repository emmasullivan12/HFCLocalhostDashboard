Mainly it is used for fx and stuff but it will help with developing an understanding of a procedural work flow as it is all node based but also opens things out for coding through VEX language and you can do incredible things with it. Unlike blender and cinema 4d it is also widely used through the professional industry. The company that makes it is called sidefx and they have a great vimeo channel with tutorials. also there is a really good forum community on odforce and also check out entagma which is a site doing really cool stuff in houdini and has great tutorials.",
