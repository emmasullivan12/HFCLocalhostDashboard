The only title on my production experience, as of current, is my graduate film \"Sweetness and Light\" where I was producer, and Head of CG (across all aspects of the pipeline). I'm London based currently. I want to work as a producer for VFX as my long term goal. So I've been applying to a lot of production assistant and runner positions at the moment. However, I'm not opposed to other forms of producing, I think there is a lot to learn from every area.",
