Don’t get discouraged as you apply, openings for runners come up all the time. Remember to keep following up in a friendly note once a month or so with the people you’ve met already. In all my years the one thing I have found that is beyond simple in the job hunt is Following Up. I have received multiple roles from this skill, including Discovery Channel (followed up with a contact I had met 7 years before!). \n\nDo you have any connections to seek out PA roles for on-set shoots while you look? It’s good freelance work if you can get in with a crew, and if you can connect with companies shooting VFX elements that’s an even better skill to learn for when you’re producing the content on the backside. Hard to hone in on that kind of shoot though unless it’s Mill+, for example. \n\nDoes UK use LinkedIn? I have had a lot of luck using that tool as well. Following companies I like, requesting to connect with the appropriate people there (HoP, other producers) and then offering to take them to coffee. Most people will turn you down, but if you get someone to accept its well worth the 15 quid. Be strategic! \n\nWhat other questions can I help with?? :relaxed:",
