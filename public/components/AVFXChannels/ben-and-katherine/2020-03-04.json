You can also do some nice breakdowns too if you have lots of DMP and cleanup and stuff And nice, that's a good idea. When it comes down to showreels its often quality over quantity so its best to have your best work in there if you can! I'll take a look at your reel soon and let you know what I think! Have you got any other projects on atm or is it just your FMP?",
