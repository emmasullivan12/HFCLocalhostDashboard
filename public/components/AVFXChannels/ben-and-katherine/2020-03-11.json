I had just handed in my notice at DNEG so had a very busy few weeks wrapping up on the project I was on! I’m gonna be starting at a smaller place called Automatik on Monday! It feels really weird to be leaving Dneg but it’s the right thing for me right now!\n\nAs for getting into Dneg I totally think you could! They were hiring for a tech checker in the TV department recently and that’s the way I got myself into an artist role so there are always was in, it’s just about finding them and being in the right place at the right time!",
