The VR project is finished by the way and handed in - I can send you the cinematic when I get time. We have just started another group project, it has just started so it's alot of preproduction. How is working at Blue zoo? Also how is ray traced rending in UE4 going ? Are you using any custom tools to improve workflow?",
