        "text": "Helo Guian. Hope you had a great weekend. The company I work for does VFX on films and episodic television.  I help run the business so get involved in all aspects of what we do. It's very varied.  I'm involved in pitching for new business, working to insure we have the right crew and technology to do the job well, that things are running smoothly, that we get paid when the job is done and are allowed to promote the work afterwards. Don't really have a very 'typical' day.  It depends what stage we're at with different projects.  Hope this helps.",
