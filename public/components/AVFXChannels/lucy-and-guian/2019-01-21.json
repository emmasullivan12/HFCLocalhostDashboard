Maybe the initial home screen could be more exciting. Display some of your work.\n\nI found the infomation given was very interesting and descriptive in the first section and this followed through to the following Human figure and life drawing studies. Desplayed a good attention to detail both in description and drawing skill.\n\nI enjoyed the section about animation, very informative with a variety of information to look though which displayed Guian’s thought process well from story boards, project breakdown and final outcome. Explained the different stages to the project and was easy to follow. Some images wouldn’t display?\n\nVery impressive.\n\nDom Maidlow\nMatchmove Artist\/ CG Generalist",
