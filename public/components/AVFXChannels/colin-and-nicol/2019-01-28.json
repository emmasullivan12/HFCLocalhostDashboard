You might not get an actor you wanted, or a location, or you come to realise in rehearsals that an aspect of your script just doesn’t work. These things are inevitable and you will have to be creative to find a way forward. You are the director so you lead this process and have the final say (hopefully!) in what will happen. Embrace these problems and work creatively with the people around you, you are now bringing the written script to life and it is changing and becoming something new in the process.",
