I am so excited to learn more from you and have a fruitful cooperation.\n\nI am Kate and I recently relocated to Montreal, Canada from Ukraine. I have so many things to say about my background as I have more than 7 years of professional experience in different industries. I’ll try to be short to describe a general picture of who I am and if you want to know more I’d be glad to share more.\n\nI’ve been managing teams and projects from different industries and countries online and offline for 7 years while working as a Digital Project Manager, Line Producer, Communication Specialist, HR-manager and as an Event-manager. If there is one position that unites all my job experiences, it would be the Project manager, a specialist, who manages people and organizes a fruitful workflow.\nIn my previous position as a Line Producer at Wow-How Studio, the top video production company named\nby Clutch, I had a wide range of responsibilities, managed a few creative teams and 2 coordinators under\nmy supervision. The projects I worked on were in 2D and 3D animation, VFX production, CG modeling,\nconcept art creation mainly for advertisingand marketing purposes.\nWhile working in the fast-paced environment on 10-projects simultaneously I was responsible for creating a\nschedule for all phases of production and working with Technical Leads to assign digital artists to the work\nto successfully deliver 100% of the projects within a deadline driven creative environment. I acted as a\ndelivery manager and communicated with internal and external international clients like Google and TED-Ed\nto manage edits, oversee the execution of client deliveries of all temps and finals. Performing as a problemsolver\nand a professional who can stay calm in stressful situations I predicted and resolved a few conflicts\nand kept projects on the track.",
