I fully understand the point of view you are coming from.  I understand that I need to know the type of person I am first before taking any steps forward in pursuing any targets and goals.  I guess this is what I need to do first, followed by settings targets with smaller sub-targets.  The point you made about comparing myself to others is such a valid point that I am guilty of and perhaps need to stop (but I guess it's natural).  At this stage what I will do before I continue is to take a step back and re-evaluate my plans and steps needed to achieve them.  Thanks for the video, I'll give it a watch.  Seun",
