It was an opportunity that showed up and I felt the need to experience, as much as I love working at Framestore, if I don't try this one, I'm not sure I'll ever get the chance to again, so I'm jumping on this opportunity as a chance to learn from a different experience :smiley:\nLet me know if you have any questions about it!",
