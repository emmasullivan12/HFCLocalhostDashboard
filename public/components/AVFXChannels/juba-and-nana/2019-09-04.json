In that same way 6 months may go by, and by spending a little bit of time everyday you end up achieving a lot more than if you had done nothing.\nPerseverance is key here, to push past the routine and the resistance our brain has these things. You'll be surprised by how much you can achieve if you just put in some time everyday.\nHope you are well and pushing towards your goals Nana!",
