It's interesting when consoles do them and I think it's cool to push the tech forwards but you'll always be \"stuck\" with the previous tech, because you don't want to alienate the consumers who own the first version of your console.\nSay for instance Bloodborne, they didn't make a performance patch for the ps4 pro to 60fps because it would give the players a tactical advantage in pvp over the people on just a ps4. If they started modularly designing consoles to be upgradable, that might be smarter, although that hasn't really worked out financially in the past.\nSince this was the first generation this happened, I think it will improve from here, companies will find smarter ways to do it",
