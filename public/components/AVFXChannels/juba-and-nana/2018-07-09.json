To quickly go through my path so far,  I was born in Brazil and have a Bachelor in Game Design, my goal was to work in game animation but ended up shifting paths to work in film. I went to Vancouver Film School to study 3D Animation and graduated with honors in their programme. I'm now working at Framestore as an Animator, I worked on a few movies so far, including Thor Ragnarok, the upcoming Mowgli, Christopher Robin and I'm currently working on the second Fantastic Beasts. OK, with that out of the way, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your journey so far and all that. Also what game\/s have you been playing recently?",
