And strength's and weaknesses for me right now are more technical things, personally I feel like still have a long way to go to become a great Animator, especially in regards to timing and spacing. It's something I'm working towards improving over the next year. \nMy greatest strength, I feel, is perseverance. Because I know that if I'm struggling with a shot or I hit a wall, I'll find a way to get through it, and improve myself as an artist. I know how corny that sounds but perseverance is stronger than talent by a long shot.",

It's a mix of artistic and technical experience. \nI know Unity has a pretty decent particle system, that let's you change a lot of attributes to get the result you want. If you struggle with it, I would definitely just take time and explore it top to bottom, try different things, scour the net for tutorials. I wouldn't be afraid to make mistakes at this point since I'm just trying to learn the system, it's what I do with animation in fact.\nIn that sense you have to take the initiative Nana, if you know you struggle with something and want to improve on it, don't waste time and don't leave it for tomorrow (it's not easy, but that's where perseverance is key). One way to think of it is to do it in small focused chunks, take some time to just learn what each attribute does in the particle system, another day on applying your own art to it etc... \nDo it in a playful way, like you are exploring something, it takes the pressure off and makes it a ton more enjoyable :smiley: \nAnd please, show me what you make and study, I can provide you with feedback and help you improve!",
