It's hard to balance honestly, can't tell you I know how to do that properly. I try to focus on my life goals first, I want to become a director, so I focus on hobbies that can complement or help me get there. Like drawing and writing, but sometimes I need a break so I fall to my other hobbies.\nHope that helps, what hobbies do you have?",
