I think they have their place in the industry, and I know that naughty dog is really pushing the line of integrating cinematic moments into gameplay with Last of Us, but I don't think it's the best way to tell stories. You end up disengaging the player in cut-scenes and creating a separation of gameplay vs. story, relying heavily on suspension of disbelief for those moments and the gameplay itself.\nVideogames are their own thing, for me games like Inside, Brothers, Bioshock and even Dark Souls have a more powerful impact on me than games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted.\nMood and environmental storytelling are an immersive way to tell your tale to your players rather than adding a close up 50mm camera and have two characters banter with one another. :smiley:\n\nI'd love to hear what you think on it though!",
