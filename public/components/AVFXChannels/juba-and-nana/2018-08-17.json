The naughty dog games do a better job of blending the game with story.\nI just feel like those games are just trying to emulate what has already been done on film. We know films can be engaging but there's something to pushing the envelope of storytelling in games. It's part of our jobs as artists to explore and invent new ways that might be more interesting for the medium. Naughty Dog and Crystal Dynamics focus a lot on pushing the realism technology forward, which is also cool for the industry as a whole =D",
