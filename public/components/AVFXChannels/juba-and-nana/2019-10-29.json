Next you can try the same type of ball but bouncing past the screen until it loses momentum and stops.\nYou can then try different types of balls, a bowling ball, a beach ball, they will all make you think differently about how they'd work and move differently.\nyou can download and use this free rig - <https:\/\/www.bloopanimation.com\/ball-rig\/>",
