Can't wait to check it out, just a head's up that I'm gonna be fairly busy over the next week but I'll check in when I can!\n\nThat's a hard question, since I don't think there's a one way answer. What I like most about anime are the stories, a lot of the time they have really creative and distinct universes with interesting characters (Cowboy Beebop, Flcl, Deathnote, Evangelion).\nWhat's hardest to say is that games are a collection of so many mediums, it's movies + music + art + entertainment etc...\nSo it draws from all those things all of the time, it just depends what kind of game you are making. Kingdom Hearts for one, draws a lot from Anime and Japanese storytelling but a game like Uncharted take's a lot from western culture and movies like Indiana Jones.\nReally good question Nana :smiley:",
