So depending on how good I can make it in the time I'm given, determines if the supervisor thinks I'm ready for bigger more difficult shots. It also shows to my colleagues what I'm capable of, which influences the social aspects of work too. On the more literal side, I have yearly performance reviews that goes into detail of what I've accomplished, my strengths, weaknesses etc.",

At Framestore, since I was working for Films, I had more time to push my shots to a higher level (although that's not always the case), currently we have tighter deadline projects which means I have to be much more efficient to get good results, it's good because it forces me to simplify and focus on the basics.\nHope that answers it!",
