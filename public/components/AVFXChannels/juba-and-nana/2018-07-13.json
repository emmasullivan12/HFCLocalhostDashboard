I'd appreciate if you could just let me know before if you can't make it :smiley:\n\nCan you elaborate on the specific advice in the game dev industry you are looking for? Are you looking for actual tips for how to make games? or how to enter the industry?\nYour website looks good Nana, very clean, easy to find information. I find that there's a lot of different work in your portfolio, and I would focus of having only the things in the area you'd like to work in. Which brings me to this, it's still unclear to me what you are looking to do in game development. If you don't know that's totally fine, it could be a goal to figure out, but it's very important to know what you are striving towards.",
