They are all very friendly and I love to see the natural waterfalls and rainforests. Jamaica for me is one of the most amazing places I have been to, I paid a local to take me to the non tourist areas which were beautiful and he only charged the equivalent of Â£10 for a full day, I gave him quite a bit more and he said he would not need to work for the month now as I had paid his monthly wage. The different way of living is unbelievable! ",
