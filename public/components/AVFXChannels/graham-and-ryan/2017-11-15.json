The climate out there is also very different because when I landed I could barely breathe the air was so humid and there seems to be smog or just everywhere as it a very industrialised country. Then from Beijing we took the trains-Siberian express train to Mongolia and Mongolia was very nice and relaxing compared to Beijing. The culture is very different, they live in Gurs which are like mud huts but nicer. They village we stayed in was extremely hospitable and we helped out with the daily jobs like carrying water back and forth from the clean water stream because it's quite near the mountains. The food is so nice in Asia all authentic and locally sourced and life is very simplistic there, it's like living in the countryside except with aborigines. I loved it. Where abouts in the  Caribbean do you go to and why.",
