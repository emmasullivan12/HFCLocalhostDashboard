I think that have a good reference to match (or not) will give you a good understanding of what you need. If you are doing vfx, for sure you need a reference. But even in feature, if you check the demo reel of the greatest animators, you can see that almost everyone have a reference to work in their shots. Would you prefer to go to Feature or vfx?",

But vfx has his owns.\n-The first one and more important is that depends in which project you land. Probably is more boring to clean mocap for a Superheroes movie, than do for exemple Paddington, or Christopher Robin. Now there's a lot of vfx shows that has a little of \"feature\" style, that's the reason what I'm here :slightly_smiling_face:\n-There much much work, and job opportunities on vfx, due the amoung of movies that need vfx every years.\n-And maybe the most interesting to you,  usually the vfx companies are happy to hire beginners.\n-And the last one (that maybe don't interest you) here in Uk there more vfx companies than feature, a lot more.",
