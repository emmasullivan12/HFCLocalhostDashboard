I love being able to breathe life into a script and the marriage of animation and cinematography is just perfect for me, so I've been working on building a board portfolio.\nAll of my boards are on my website <http:\/\/www.bengardener.com|www.bengardener.com> and the animatics are also on my vimeo page <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/bengardenerart>\nI really want to work in TV animation and get a feel for series development, as I love cartoons and my style lends itself well to this. However, at this stage I think the most beneficial thing I can do is to get any client work I can just to be able to demonstrate the completion of briefs etc.\nDo you have any tips on that front? I hear that trawling hashtags on FB and twitter is effective, have you found that to be so?",
