Let me try and explain this with an example , might make more sense . \nLet’s take a simple task like generating neutral colour ( let me know if you are not familiar with the term ) \nStage 1 comper : can visually match the colours and generate a neutral grade using a gizmo designed for the purpose . Doesn’t know what’s happening inside the gizmo. \n\nStage 2 more technical : knows about the colour pipeline and that the grading needs to be done in log space . In essence , has the ability to build the gizmo using the appropriate nodes . \n\nStage 3: knows about setting up the gizmo with the appropriate callbacks so that it picks up the shot specific neutral grades of one has been previously generated and load it on node creation (needs python knowledge for this bit ) \n\nYou don’t necessarily have to be proficient at python but the reason I suggested that was so you can stand out . The more versatile you are , the better your prospects will be and since you still in uni it’s the perfect time to learn as much as you can . :)  ",
