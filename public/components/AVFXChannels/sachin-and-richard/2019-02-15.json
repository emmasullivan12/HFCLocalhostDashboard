I’m guessing this is in person and not over messaging or phone so will have to check as it is quite busy at the moment . \nYes I was a compositor but that was a long time back , for a short period and in India so not sure if it’s going to be relevant at all . But I’d be happy to share details of my experience if you want me to :) \n\n",
