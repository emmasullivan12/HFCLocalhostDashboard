( there are a couple of really good python courses on Udemy if you are looking for a structured video lessons ) . Or you could use on of the the python books . You can always ask me if you have trouble understanding any of the concepts . \nOnce you understand the basics you can start looking at some Nuke script examples ( can find a lot of them on Nukepedia) and understanding them won’t be an issue casue it’s basically python for Nuke . That’s for later though. To start with , keep it simple and just try understanding the basics of python . \n",
