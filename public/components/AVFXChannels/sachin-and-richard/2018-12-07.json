Especially As a compositor , it can take a while before you actually get to comp. \nThe thing with big studios is that most jobs are specialised and not the most congenial environment to acquire a wide variety of skills quickly . \nDon’t get me wrong . I’m not saying you won’t learn . Just that at a smaller studio , you end up having to wear multiple hats and doing a lot of different things that give you an edge when you go to a bigger studio because you will have a better understanding of the pipeline. \nUltimately it depends on you style of learning . I personally like jumping into the deep end right from the beginning and working at a smaller studio let’s you do that. \nIf you prefer to take it slower and gradually build up you skills then a bigger studio is more suitable . \nIt’s great that you have a high level of interest \nDo you have any experience with coding ? Python scripting ? Technical compers are a rare breed so if you can code that’ll definitely bolster your profile . \n\n",
