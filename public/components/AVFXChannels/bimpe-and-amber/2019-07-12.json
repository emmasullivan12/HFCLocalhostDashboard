I’m aiming to improve my hard surface modelling skills and texturing skills as well. I do prefer modelling assets over character modelling. \n\nSo, you did a mixture of things. Which must of been challenging but fun as well. Is that a normal thing when working as a Art Assistant? \n\nAnd Wow! You used to work at Sony Music! That’s sounds really cool. So Why? The career change? \n\nYes, I really want to inspire women of colour join the industry. All my academics life I have been interested in ICT and VFX industry. I never seen any other ethnicity except from Caucasian. It really did discourage me about the industry but I realised that  I could change things one day. \n\nI’ve made sure I continued to go to events and try to educate other people about who I am, where I came from and how interested I am in working in the industry. Also, I moved from my hometown Manchester to have a better opportunity in London to get into the VFX industry as well. The industry is changing for the better but I think it just needs a little more of a push especially in the technical side. ",
