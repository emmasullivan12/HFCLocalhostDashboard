It would be great to find out more about what areas you think I can help with. I read a short intro that Dexter sent me and it sounds like you have a pretty good idea of where you want to head with your career.  I would be very happy to give you more info on that (I have worked in Games, Animation and VFX so have a pretty good understanding of career routes in all those areas) or anything else you think I could help with.",

Character design is something I would be interested in and I am considering creating a hybrid animation for my course project. Is there any advice you may have in reference to either of these areas? Would it be possible for me to send you some character design sheets I have been working on for any feedback?\n\nThank you so much and I look forward to further correspondence,\nSincerely,\nRebecca.
