It would be great to know more about the type of characters you like, or would like to design - is is your work cartoony, or more realistic? Creatures or humanoid?  Also are you thinking about design characters for a specific outcome - an animation project - if so is that going to be 2D or 3D?  All of these questions help buld a picture of the approach you take.  Also can tell me more about what you mean by a hybrid animation?",
