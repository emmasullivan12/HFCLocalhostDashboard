It is really important to have a solid backstory and something you believe in.  Too often we see work, especially in character design, where students have worked on designs without direction or solid hook that the characters are grounded in.  Interesting here that the story is also relates to the ambition of the project!  It would be great to see an animatic if you can send it - also would love to see the designs for the look and feel of the 3D environments.  Very interested to see how the 2D animation is going to sit in the 3D â€“ as more often we would see the reverse, 3D characters in a 2D environment.",
