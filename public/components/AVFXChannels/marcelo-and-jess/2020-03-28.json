It's lovely to meet you! Story boarding sounds interesting, I hope the UK has been treating you well! I'm Jess, a freelance illustrator (from the UK) who's looking to work in the animation industry, ideally in layout or bg painting (I'm a big sucker for colours), or visdev.\n\nI've previously studied illustration and animation, but I love always trying to branch out my knowledge and grow more, as soon as I seen Prospela's post on Twitter regarding mentors\/students I jumped on it, it's lovely to be matched with you! I've been feeling a bit beat down lately about entering the industry, jobs seem few and far between and it leaves me feeling a bit stagnant, bleh. I've heard of It's Pony, have you been enjoying working on it?",
