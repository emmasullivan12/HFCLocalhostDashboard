From my point of view, especially now with Brexit and even more with isolation we tend to feel helpless. \nThere's a lot of productions in the UK though. Not as many in TV series as there seems to be in Ireland, but if you're ok with moving, I think there's going to be a lot going on in those 2 countries for a while, not to mention the rest of Europe, but Ireland is one of the most active and varied market for TV animation around here. \nBut I would like to stay in the UK and hope for local productions, if that's your case too",
