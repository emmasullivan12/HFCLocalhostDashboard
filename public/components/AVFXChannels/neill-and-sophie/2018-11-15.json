I finished my second year in June and currently doing a placement year before I return for my third year in September next year. So this has been an opportunity for me to gain experience in the industry. I’m currently a runner at Evolutions post productions in Soho but my contract ends at the end of this year and I would love to get some experience\/an internship with a VFX house for the rest of my placement year as I want to be a compositor. I was wondering if you had any advice of how I could get an internship or experience with a VFX house? I have a CV and portfolio\/show reels but not sure if I have the relevant experience\/work to secure a placement? ",

This gives a strong grounding in the necessary software and techniques but without quite as much pressure as a comp role. Have you considered building a paint and roto reel and taking that route?",
