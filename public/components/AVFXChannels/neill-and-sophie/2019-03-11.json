Thank you, once I’ve done this work on the short and a few other bits I’m going to compile a new show reel, CV, and cover letter, it’ll be great if you had a any spare time if you could look at it once I’ve finished putting it together! I had a look at that launchpad scheme Framestore run and it looks perfect! I think the application window is open for a little while so I’m going to try my best to put together my best show reel before it closes and go for it! Thank you again for all your help and advice! I’m going to keep an eye out for any other internships VFX houses may run over the summer, as this would be perfect to do before I go back for my final year of university in September. ",
