I am currently working on temp \/ trailer shots for Detective Pikachu so things have been pretty crazy here recently.\n\nCompanies normally take people on for short contracts. 3 months is pretty standard, but sometimes shorter if they have a sudden need to get more people in to finish a particular show. It will come down to being lucky with the timing I think. Stock footage is fine to use for your reel so long as the quality is high enough. Be cautious using peoples footage without permission though! You can get some pretty decent free royalty free clips of people or moving things to use. for roto practice. It doesn't need to be super complicated, just show a nice matte (normally in red) overlaid over the footage. If you can get hold of some footage with tracking markers in it they're a good task to demonstrate removing for a junior artist as well.\n\nI would be happy to look at whatever you're working and give you some feedback. I have just put together my first showreel since graduating so I appreciate it's a daunting task!",
