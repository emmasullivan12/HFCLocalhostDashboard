Iâ€™m gonna start working more on my p&amp;r reel because this sounds like the route to go! So would you think that if I applied to p&amp;r roles they would take me in just for a few months? Could I use stock footage to practice p&amp;r and use for my reel or would recruiters prefer to see stuff you have shot yourself? ",
