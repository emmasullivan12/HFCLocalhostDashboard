I hope everything is going well on Detective Pikachu, bet that’s been cool to work on!\n\nSince we last spoke I finished my contract with Evolutions and currently freelancing until I find something more permanent. I recently got work on a short film to do some junior VFX and compositing work such as clean up work and inserts. I’m hoping this will be good to build up my showreel and potentially help me in the future to have a better chance of securing junior comp roles\/internships. I was wondering if I could show you some of this work once I start working on the project? I was also wondering whether you have in any advice on what else I could be doing in the mean time to make my work\/application look better when applying for internships? I’m hoping to apply for and secure a spring\/summer internship. ",
