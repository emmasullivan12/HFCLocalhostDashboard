You have nice attention to detail in terms of presentation and spelling (you’d be amazed how many people ignore this).  It’s obviously a work in progress, but I think it’s a great start.  I like your style.  If you’re happy I will share this with a creative on my team for some additional feedback. Let me know.  :slightly_smiling_face:",
