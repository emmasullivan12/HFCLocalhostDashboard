I didnâ€™t expect you to look at everything instantly :slightly_smiling_face: I think had I known more about marketing or business degrees when I was applying I probably would have gone that way which is where I ended up.  Can you tell me where the courses are that you are thinking of applying for?  I can then do a bit of homework for you on the context of them and what their graduates are up to and send it back.  It might be helpful for you.",
