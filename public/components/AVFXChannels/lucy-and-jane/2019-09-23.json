If you’re studying something you’re not passionate about it’s really difficult to do well.  Most decisions in life are not forever.  Lots of people I know have had varied paths in their careers, moving and transitioning until they find the right fit.  Some of them went to university later after working for a while or not at all.  Some of my team have done complete career changes.  If someone is passionate about something there is always a way to get there. My advice would be to follow your passions.",

I don’t regret my choices, but if I had my time again I might have gone a different way.  I only knew what I knew.
