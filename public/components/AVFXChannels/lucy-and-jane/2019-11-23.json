Thanks for showing my work to her :grinning: \n\nApolgies about the fact I don't have many new things I'm comfortable with showing you right now since everything is a work in progress at this stage. \nWhen there's enough new content, I'll be sure to send it over though. \n\nI hope your weekend is going well",
