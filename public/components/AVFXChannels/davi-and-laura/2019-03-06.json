Techniques cal always be taught, but ideas come from you :wink:\nSo wrote down your ideas on your animation and be ready to explain them so they can also evaluate your artist thoughts. \n\nAn interview is a chance to sell yourself!! \n\nSo be proud of what you have accomplished already which is great! and then entice them what you desire to learn more about by using your artwork as examples to explain how you want to advance your ideas, and techniques. .
