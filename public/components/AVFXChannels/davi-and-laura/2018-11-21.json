So make them abstract, and out of context of what and how  you normally see them. \nFurther challenge: use the same object for a week. Then the next week switch to another. Staying on the same object will force you to look at the object in different ways. \nTry for say 1 week, 2 weeks if you can. \nThe more often you shoot, say daily, thenthe more often you can switch objects. \nThen I can add other photography challenges that are more thought provoking. \nI can give some famous art photographers list as a reference for ideas. \nThen post the images, daily if you want or weekly summary. \nWhat do you think?
