Good start! \nI like the bottom 2 photos relating to there brief. \nThe blue sky with the sole plane in the corner: creates a comparison of space and scale between the centre, left and right sides of the framing\/composition. \nAnd the bottom flower: nice use of depth of field (defocus) to isolate the foreground flower. \n\n",
