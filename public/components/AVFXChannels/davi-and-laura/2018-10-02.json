Why his style? \nWhat about his style that appeals to you? But more importantly what part of you, or identity of you feels related to his style? \n\nIt sounds for this project you need to identify first your ‘identity’. That is the core.  Do let me know if I’m off track ;) \nSo it’s like a story or film: what is the core part (narrative, purpose of the film\/story). Start with that and then the visuals can be researched. And I can try to suggest artists that suit that defined is identity. Then the fun art research begins! \n",
