                "text": "Do you love animation? Are you a parent, teacher or carer of a keen animator and want to find out more about how they can channel their love for animation into an exciting career in the visual effects (VFX), animation and games industries? According to a recent Screen Business report released last October, the UK’s visual effects and animation industry generates more than one billion pounds of added value for the UK economy. This shows VFX to be a vital component of the UK’s successful film, TV and advertising industries. This Summer ACCESS: VFX will partner with London SIGGRAPH, 3Dami, Escape Studios and We Are Stripes to host our ‘Animation Summer School’ a 3-day family-event for 11-16-year olds interested in a career in the exciting UK animation industry. We will host a range of free workshops across 3 days on: Thursday 8th August Friday 9th August Saturday 10th August Each day will be it's own stand-alone event, so whether you sign up to just one day, or all three dates, there will not be an order to the Summer School. What can I expect? On the Thursday, Escape Studios will host two 3-hour Maya taster sessions and 3Dami students will run 45 minute Blender Hangouts all day. There will also be workshops and talks hosted by The Mill, Blue Zoo and ILM. On the Friday we will have another Maya taster session and Blender Hangouts taking place all-day. There will also be workshops and sessions hosted by Blue Zoo, DNEG and we are lucky to have an exclusive 'stop motion' workshop with artist Valentina Grasso. On the Saturday we will have Blender Hangouts with past and current 3Dami students taking place all-day. There will also be a workshops hosted by Blue Zoo, The Mill and more. On the final day we will welcome motion designer and creative Stephanie Dewhirst who will run a workshop on her craft. On each day we will hold a panel discussion so you can hear direct from idustry speakers working in animation and visual effects who have secured their role through entry level opportunities, whether via the apprenticeship route, internships, running programmes and other avenues. Across the event, Animation Mentor have kindly donated one of their 8 week Maya courses that we will be giving away as prizes! As you read this we continue to build the content across the 3 day event and can promise there will be some surprises.
