                "text": "This exhibition showcases the recent work of artist Scott Eaton combining the latest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) with the centuries old practices of drawing and sculpture. The show's featured works are the result of the dynamic interaction between Scott's traditionally-trained hand and the AI tools he has ‘taught’ to work as his assistants. In this show, Eaton, an interdisciplinary artist with backgrounds in sculpture, anatomy and design, underscores the impact AI is set to have on the art-making process. The exhibition features a diverse collection of drawings, prints, sculpture and video, each somehow reflecting the theme of \"Figures &amp; Form\". This is a free, but ticketed, private exhibition, please book your ticket here in advance.   Special thanks to our sponsors: Lenovo Panavision Direct Digital Raw Umber Studios And Somerset House Studios for helping coordinate the show.",

It delves into many other mind-blowing aspects, offering a whole new vision of our interpretation of art.\n\nWe thought it was something very different but also interestingly relevant for you guys to check out.\nIt was hard to do it justice in the short paragraph we have written but please check out this article.\n\nIf you already convinced, follow the link below to reserve your ticket!",
