I'm going abroad tomorrow so I won't be able to go to the event today at Somerset House, thanks for the info though. I will try to take lots of photos when I'm abroad taking into consideration the composition tips you were telling me about. I don't know if I'll be able to text you whilst I'm there. I'll be back by early-mid July. Hope you are well and enjoy the summer!",
