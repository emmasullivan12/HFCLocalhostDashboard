For now, include pieces that you are not sure  as well and we can always edit them down to the most appropriate, or best pieces. Eventually we will design a portfolio specifically catering to BRITS :wink:\n\n2) if they gave any info or description of what they want to see in the portfolio, then send me that and I will get a good idea of what they are linking for.
