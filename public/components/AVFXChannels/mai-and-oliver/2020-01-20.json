I would also keep the chimpanzee shot and the cat shot as they would be the easiest to refine and have a lot of potential. I think the 'tv show' lipsync shot has too much hand movement and the acting choices would need a bit of refining as well, so it might take too long to get it show reel ready. It would be safer to invest that energy into the other shots :slightly_smiling_face: your 2d stuff is also really nice, so I would keep it in there :slightly_smiling_face:",
