Instead, I'm going to work on building up my showreel and working on a couple of small animations to compliment the main ones and strengthen my skillset. So I'm going to enter the animdojo April competition which is just a heavy ball lift as it's more simple and I can use it to practice improving my skillset, so I was wondering if I sent you the base files you could help me understand the best way to block and plan out an animation like that :)",
