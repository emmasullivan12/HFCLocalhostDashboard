I'm Lucy, as Emma said, and she thought I'd be the ideal person to talk to you since I studied Computer Science at uni and entered as a software developer in the visual effects industry. I now work at Framestore where I started on graduation in 2017, but did a year placement there as part of my degree so got to go back after my final year of uni. I started out in their R&amp;D department working in computer graphics using C++ for making plugins in Autodesk Maya (vfx's main software) and since January I have moved positions into being an Assistant Technical Director which is a lot less technical, though I still do a fair amount of Python scripting and I help production, artists and the supervisors on a film project by developing tools and fixing things to make sure everything moves along nicely. That's my most basic summary haha, but of course I can go into plenty more detail into whatever you care about! :slightly_smiling_face:",
