However I've also really wanted to do architecture and\/or a career in graphic design but my chosen a levels won't help me get into those careers. I'm not clear in what I want to do exactly but teaching sounds great! \nHave you got any advice to offer me? or introduce yourself to me (what made you think teaching was the right career for you? Were you confused too?)",
