I didn't know you had to take test in studios ! What kind of test are they ?? \nWhat studios did you apply to if you don't mind me asking !? But fingers crossed you get the studio you want to go to !!\n\n\nWhat kind of things do you make in zbrush ? More of like characters or props ???\n\nI have heard Blender is pretty good !
