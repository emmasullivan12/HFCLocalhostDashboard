From what you've said, a good starting point is probably thinking about the skills that are involved in what you enjoy - what skills do you need to study history? Which of those skills might be useful when working as a lawyer?",

I also think good organisation skills are required in both studying history and being a lawyer because i need to organise my work aswell as my time so i dont lose track of everything. I know that effective communication and confidence is key as in history you have to put across you view\/ perspective and stand by what you say which would be useful to a lawyer when working in court or on cases ",
