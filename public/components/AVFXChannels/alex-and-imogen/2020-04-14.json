It was set up by some people from Blue Zoo and when I was working there last year they gave me a free account, it was pretty good.\n\nAnyway if you don't already have an account I'd recommend signing up while it's free. They have some really good classes on there and it has challenges you can take part in and get feedback on etc.\n\n<https:\/\/beta.animdojo.com\/app\/lobby>",
