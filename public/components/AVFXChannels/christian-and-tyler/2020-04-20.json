        "text": "Hi Tyler. For the rock shading, this is all about getting the details in your matte painting consistent. So the majority of the rocks have this nice hilight that's coming from the top-left, however the pinnacle-like rock on screen right looks a bit flat in comparison, because its shading is dark all over. If you use a Grade node with a Roto node plugged into its mask input you can selectively brighten up an area of the rock by drawing a shape (or shapes) at the upper-left portion of the rock. Because the rock is pretty dark, you can use the \"offset\" control to add brightness. If the rock is a mid-grey you can use the \"gain\" or \"multiply\" sliders to increase the brightness (they both do the same thing, which is multiply the pixel values by the slider amount). Notice \"offset\" defaults to 0, because offset is an additive control, i.e. adds the value of the slider to the pixels, and \"gain\/multiply\" default to 1 because it's multiplying. To add extra detail, use different opacity mask shapes, with larger areas at low opacity, and small, detail areas higher opacity. The higher the opacity the more the Grade will take effect. But first get the general shape of the hilight with a single roto shape, opacity set to, say 0.5, and play with the grade node to set the level. It's all about experimenting.",

        "text": "For grain, it's a choice that your supervisor will help make. Most of the time we prefer to retain as much grain as possible from the live-action plate; in this case your actress walking across frame. The reason for this is that if you de-grain footage some of the detail goes with it. In such cases you'd have to add grain to the rest of the shot to match the grain of the plate, whilst \"holding out\" the matte of the character. Grain matching is an art, and something I can't really teach on Slack!",
