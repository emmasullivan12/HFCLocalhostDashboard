I'll def have a go at offsetting the timings, that was something I didn't even notice so I'm v glad you could take a look it. Something to remember for the future I think. I gave the video a play and sorry realised I hadn't exported it with sound! I'll attach another version with the (hopefully) fixed sound, and I'll offset the hands and repose them to get rid of the symmetry, would love to hear what you think. I'm not surprised to hear the CV is rarely ever looked at haha but I'm glad you've told me how to get it right. Will remove all of the drawings and just leave the layout, are the little icons ok to leave in? Oo also do you mean I should remove the little screengrabs for the two case study projects as well? Very good point on the intro, I'll chuck that out. Somehow not surprised to hear 'quadruped animation' is a buzzword hahaha so I'll put that in too, is it worth putting more quadruped shots in my showreel? (Realised my 'website' domain isn't actually active yet aha, I'm hoping to get it up and running today)",

I was also wondering if you think I should even be thinking about applying for a job yet aha, or if I'm not at that level yet.
