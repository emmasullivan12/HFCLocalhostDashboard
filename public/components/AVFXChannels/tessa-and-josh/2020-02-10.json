You have a bunch of reference (which is great), but for your shot I'd suggest picking one that's good and sticking to it as being your driver for what you do with your animation, meaning you'll use it to animate your shot to and ignore everything else to a degree. Your other ref will be good for understanding mechanics and getting different angles on what's happening, but you've got 2 shots that are pretty similar in camera angle, so might as well use those to nail the action. :smiley:",
