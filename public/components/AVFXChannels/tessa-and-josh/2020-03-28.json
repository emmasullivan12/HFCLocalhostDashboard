Hopefully you've been able to start working from home, either way stay safe.\nOn a lighter note, here is a quick update of the shots I've been working on. A developed Sh05 - <https:\/\/syncsketch.com\/sketch\/d60b026a1348\/> thank you for the crit, it was a huge help :slightly_smiling_face:, I think this shot is almost ready to render, but if there is anything that sticks out please don't hesitate to point it out. Here is Sh01 <https:\/\/syncsketch.com\/sketch\/78370869e13e\/>, I've gotten this shot blocked and have done a first pass on it, again if there is anything that sticks out as non-dog-like please let me know, I'll have more to show soon, and I'll try my best to keep you updated :slightly_smiling_face:",

Sh05 is definitely looking better, and Sh01 has a lot of good stuff going on. I do have some notes one both, so I'll see if I can get those to you soon. :slightly_smiling_face: Awesome to see an update!",
