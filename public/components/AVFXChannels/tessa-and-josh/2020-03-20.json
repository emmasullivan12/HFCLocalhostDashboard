All good here at the moment thanks, hope the same can be said for you and you're family :slightly_smiling_face:\nOhh, thanks for the link, this is definitely super useful. My University has pretty much gone fully online and this will last until late April, so literally everyone is working from home! Crazy times!",

I will send updates occasionally when I have something useful to share like the podcast, but you're under no obligation to send regular updates.\nI'm glad to hear your university is taking the online approach. Things are mostly safe on this end. My only worry is that I'm still working in the office at the moment, but hopefully, by next week we'll be moved out of the office and working from home. Fingers crossed.",
