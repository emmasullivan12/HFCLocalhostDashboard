We also have \"dailies\", which are 30 minutes to an hour meetings with the supervisors on the film and artists from other departments, to talk about a specific topic on the film. It's mainly working towards any deadlines we've been set and talking to other departments so that we can pick up any assets that we need and also pass on our work to whomever needs it.",
