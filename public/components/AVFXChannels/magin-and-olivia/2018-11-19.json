This kind of stuff, that could be worth to me. That will help me a lot!\nThe other thing, would be nice, if you are able to upload your anim to a free platform called \"Syncscketch\". It's awesome to give proper feedback. :slightly_smiling_face:",

I did try it a few years ago but i didn't enjoy it so i moved onto trying other things, anyway I went back to it this January and since then its the only thing I've done\/specialized in. I'm currently working on a dragon animation because I wanted to try and challenge myself with a weight piece and try my hand at a creature animation. I've never really done anything like this, the only creature I've animated before was a bird and that was just a quick block. ohhhhh I definitely prefer feature animation, I love acting character references out. I do however like the look of VFX but it doesn't really have a place for character animation, it seems only one film comes up every so often that fits the character animation criteria like Paddington or detective pikkachu :slightly_smiling_face:",
