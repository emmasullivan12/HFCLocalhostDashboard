Our current animation team is about 6 people and there are 3-4 teams on this project, but it's a big one so there's a lot of people.\nBlue-Zoo does have internships. We run a summer internship program, usually for students between their first and second years, or the second and third years at uni but it's really open to everyone. More information about those is usually released later on in the year when we get closer to summer so keep an eye on the Blue-Zoo Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We also have open what we call \"Speculative Applications\" which is just applying for a job even if there isn't one available. This is good for a few reasons. First, it means Blue-Zoo will have your information and you reel in the database. They keep all the information so that when a job does become available they can just look at the database and find someone who is appropriate for the position. The other good reason is that there may actually be a position available or coming available very soon so it's always good to apply, just in case. You might get lucky.",
