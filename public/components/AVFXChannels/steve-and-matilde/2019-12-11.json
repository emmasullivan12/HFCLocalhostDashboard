I was working for a games studio before and as I said there was a lot of \"other stuff\" that I was responsible for while I was there, bits of coding, bug fixing etc. but what I really wanted to do was animate all the time. When I got to bluezoo and all I had to do was animate I was very happy and have loved it ever since. The working environment, while still stressful at times, is a lot more relaxed here and they really care about your work\/home life balance, which I think is awesome.\n\nFor resources for coding I'm not 100% sure. There are loads of mobile apps out there that claim to help teach you some basic coding and I've seen news reports about how apparently loads of kids are doing it and making their own games. I don't know how simple that will be. I'll ask around the studio and see if anyone has any advice or links for you =]",
