And, I'm not sure how to frame this question, but how exactly does the process of developping a scene for an episode go?\nI hadn't heard of speculative applications before, it sounds great! Is it the sort of thing one would apply to even if they've already applied for a position in the company but haven't heard back from yet? So, would one apply to both at the same time, or only for one?\nRecently we had a guest lecturer talk about his experience in tv animation and it was really interesting! He talked about differences in his experiences in working in smaller and bigger studios among other things, I learned a lot. I'm not sure if this question makes sense, but how does one go about progressing in their career? For example, if I got a job as an inbetweener or cleaning up animations, how would I then progress into becoming an animator. Hopefully this makes sense?",
