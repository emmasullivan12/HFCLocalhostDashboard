I liked it quite a lot and it was very interesting to see how a game gets made and not just doing the animation. However, a lot of my time was also spent dealing with bug fixes, problem-solving and some coding. I have a feeling that's probably the same for most places. Unless you do cinematics animation I guess.\nIf you have any questions, please ask away. Ultimately, I'm here to answer any questions you have and give you some advice based on those questions. =]",

I'm really happy with the course, and we'll get to learn traditional, CG and stop-motion animation during the course, so that's good. Right now we're mostly learning the basics and developing our drawing skills. I'd say it's a good course for learning animation!\nThat's something I'd be interested to see as well! I do want to focus more on animation, but I think that learning a bit of coding would be good if I do end up working in games. I also wouldn't mind trying to develop my own short games as well\nI guess one of my main questions would be how you see the industry and the demand for animators? Is there a position that tends to get less applications than others, and what do you think would be the best course of action to take when applying for an animation related job? I know I'm still early in my course, but it's best to get an idea of how things work :smile:",
