Is there any project that you worked on and that is being released lately?\n\nOn my side, I’ve been busy with hand in on January and the beginning of February. And now I’m focusing on practicing more in depth UVing and lightning.\nAlso I had to start thinking about a proposal for my Research Report that I’ve to hand in on next November. Which I wanted to talk to you about.\nAs a starting point they want us to think about at list 2 topics and the ones that I came across are CGI clothes and sunset.\nThe first one might be more focused on WHY cloth behave\/wrinkle when we move. I watched Alita recently and sometimes I think that the cloth don’t look right, more like if they put a plane over her and animated as if it was a part of her body. \nThe sunset one on the other hand, I was considering it that could be a bit more practical. I have a thing for sunset. Not as a think thing that looks cool to post on social media, but that I   Can’t miss it and I try to capture the moment but is so difficult! So The research proposal be more like research how and why works a real sunset and make a CGI sunset myself.\nAs both proposals are a bit fx like I thought you could give me some inside about each of them.\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the long message!",
