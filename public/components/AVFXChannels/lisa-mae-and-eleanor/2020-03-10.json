It's a really lovely groom to start with though as it's not too dense. Often times the main pain of grooming revolves around your PC getting really laggy and slow because of the heavy scenes but you should be able to keep it light. Also bonus for your project in particular is that it's not the end of the world if you don't get the hair sim working because you probably won't notice it all that much in the end. I didn't have that blessing when I groomed a horse in my 2nd year- the mane, fringe and tail all had to be simulated in every shot which was a total nightmare haha! If I were you (obviously discuss with your team), I'd focus on getting the hair simulation looking *perfect* for only one or two shots that are close up. It would depend on how long you end up making the hair but I think you'll be alright with minimal simulation. For Wing I only simulated maybe 3 shots? Just for some context on what you can get away with if you run out of time. Would you be able to send some renders over? I'd love to see! Don't worry if it's still WIP :smile: If you've got any questions on my end just let me know (about artistic stuff or working life, whatever you want)!",
