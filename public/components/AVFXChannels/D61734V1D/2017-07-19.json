Simply ask to connect with them on LinkedIn or for their contact details :the_horns::the_horns::the_horns:\n\nThanks again for being part of our pilot so far! We know it has been short &amp; sweet, but we've learned a lot and hope to be running lengthier programmes post-Summer.\n\n&gt;It's recommended that you still make the most of your E-Mentors whilst they are fully committed, in case they can no longer be involved beyond this Friday. :got_to_run::got_to_run::got_to_run:",
