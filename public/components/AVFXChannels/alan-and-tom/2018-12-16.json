Not saying it's not possible but you'd be taking on something tough. I guess it depends on where you want to end up.  If you want to be an animator you could animate anything: a sphere animated with great timing and personality will win fans way more than a half baked rig and animation will. Does that make sense? Recruiters and supervisors want to know you could slot into a team without too much todo. Showing you understand timing and intent is the key. So in some ways it doesn't matter what you animate.  Sure if you can animate and rig Gollum or Thanos then you will be fighting off the offers. But bear in mind these people see the best animators and riggers in the world day in day out. They aren't expecting the world from you as a new hire. Just potential and a willingness to get going.",
