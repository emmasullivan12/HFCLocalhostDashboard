I don’t think the animatic I submitted is to a standard to show to any anim supes (I promise I’m not noodling :sweat_smile:) \nThe main focus was to create a production bible to showcase what I’ve been doing. Can I send it over to you to get your thoughts on it please? \nI’m hoping I can use your feedback a lot in the next few weeks too as I’ll be modelling characters in the production bible and trying to achieve an almost 2D quality to them.",
