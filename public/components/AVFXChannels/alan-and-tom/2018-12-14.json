In terms of the rig I'm not the best person to give you feedback on the ins and outs of rigging but for your animation I think keeping it basic like you are is a good idea. A character like Mike from Monsters Inc. is a great example of what you can do with a simple design. Not saying that would have been easy to rig or animate but the design is simple.",
