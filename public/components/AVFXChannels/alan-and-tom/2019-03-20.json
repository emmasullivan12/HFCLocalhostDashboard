As well as 6 backgrounds finished. \n\nSo far I’ve made 1 model with blend shapes for every character as well as lip sync and emotion blend shapes. I’m doing 2 bodies tomorrow and separate arms which I’m hoping to rig Friday, then bind them but keep them as separate joint systems so that I can scale each part independently to match every character. I’m away from my computer for tonight but I’ll send some stuff over tomorrow if you don’t mind giving feedback on the blend shapes?\n\nI’m 25 too. Do you need my date of birth?",
