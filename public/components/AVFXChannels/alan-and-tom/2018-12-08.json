If you could let me know what you'd like to get out of the program I will have a think as to where I can help. Is there anything you'd like to know about me or the movies\/projects I've worked on so far? ",

How did you start off? In what roles do people tend to have the most success in terms of progression?\nIt would be great to know a bit more about your role specifically though and what projects you’ve worked on.",
