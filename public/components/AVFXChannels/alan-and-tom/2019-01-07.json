Whereas at uni those deadlines tended to be quite hard and fast. You will certainly have milestones and targets for shots that are assigned to you.\n\nI do enjoy the role but it really depends on the team around you. If you have a great team you can work on the worst subject material and still have fun. Certain movie studios that begin with M and end with arvel can be quite tricky to work for because they delay the approval of shots\/assets until the very end. Keeps us hanging on and it's a bit of a pain to work with.\n\nHow long do you have for the project? Is there a way you would specifically like me to help\/advise you?",
