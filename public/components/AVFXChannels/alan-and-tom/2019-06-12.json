Sorry it’s been a while since I messaged, it’s been all go since I saw you last and today is my assessment day so the pressure has been on for a while.\n\nI’ve moved on to animating so I’d love to get your feedback on some of the playblasts if you don’t mind? I want to send them over to Nathan as well to have a look at. The whole schedule is overlapping though so I’m not solely working on animation yet. For example, I’ve been animating them on temporary furniture and I’ve just finished the refined furniture with the same dimensions so I can swap them straight in.\n\nHow have things been with you? How’s the business setup coming along?",
