I think you could certainly refine some of your facial animation maybe try and get some better blendshapes in there. You could also maybe do some rig ROMs (range of motion) to show what your rig is capable of. Keep the show reel short and sweet. Download some rigs from the net. I did that with some interns over thesummer. Just grab a rig which is a bit more fleshed out and see what you can do with it. Just make sure you credit that the rig wasn't yours :wink:",
