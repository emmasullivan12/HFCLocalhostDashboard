Recently I learnt silhouette and have realised how fun roto can be! I'm not really a fan of roto-ing in nuke :smile:\n\nIn regards to guitar, I play electric and anything from metal to math rock, how about you?",

I got into blues lately, so trying to learn as much as I can right now in this genre. ",
