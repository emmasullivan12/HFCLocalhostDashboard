It can be rewarding in a sense of accomplishment. When you finally get this awesome note from supe saying “Great! It’s a PAF (proposed as final).” \nIt’s a nice thing to try big companies, so if in the end you’ll get a chance to be in one, take it as you can learn tons and they have programmes to develop your skill set in other areas too. Plus loads of artists to get to know and good massive parties :D.",
