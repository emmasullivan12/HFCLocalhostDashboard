We were pushed to use mari in uni, as its a bit of a standard for features, but to be honest, i was too lazy to learn, and mostly used mudbox. We do a lot of environment work here, so i've found myself using quixels megascans and their handy blending app, which lets you blend and mix the scan-based materials. i think the allegorithmic folks have come up with something that overlaps slightly called Alchemist. I'd love to learn a bit of substance, and really like the idea of being able to create things a bit more procedurally. I think a lot of the time games art tools tend to be far more efficient, to allow for the scale of the the content needed in a game, whereas film tools seem to be a bit more laboured.",
