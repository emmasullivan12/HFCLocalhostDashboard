When the rabbit is cocking the gun his hand movement isn't synced up with the movement of the gun, although he does have a lovely facial expression. Also in your punching shot  there are some body mechanic issues. The arm facing the camera has some funky things going on with the wrist and you want to make sure the hands are always moving in an arc, not in straight lines. Also add some aggression to that rabbits face, he seems a bit sleepy even though he is punching someone. The last piece is really nice, I would actually put it at the start of your reel as its the strongest! Keep going! i'm quickly gonna check when the applications have to be handed in by",
