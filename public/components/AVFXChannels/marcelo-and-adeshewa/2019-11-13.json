I understand that inspiration for most good short films comes from one's own life experience, and from stories based on things that happened to you and subjects\/emotions\/situations you lived and understand well. I think the same applies for illustration - chances are you're going to find your style and be really good when you're doing your own thing, with the limitations you have and acknowledge, instead of trying to mimick someone's style. It might take time, but I believe it's worth it.",
