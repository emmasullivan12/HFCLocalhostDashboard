I actually studied Social Communications, which is an even broader field than Visual Communication. That's fine if you think it would be limiting, and I'd advise you talk to people who did study that so you get to know the possibilities, the current market opportunities and how it's been working out for them.\nAfter I graduated and worked a bit in animation, I ended up applying for a Character Animation course in Uni, but just attended the first year. In the end, Uninis great for you to get to know the whole field of activities you might work with, and you will certainly get more interested in one or more aspects in there, and further study it afterwards. Even in an Animation only course, I mean. If you do choose Visual Communication, you'll probably have the chance to learn about photography, video, film, graphic design, product design, typography and such. It's great as a broad arts Foundation, and it'll give you the chance to see what's in there for you, what gets you more interested. Then you can work with that and see if you really like it and do well with it.",
