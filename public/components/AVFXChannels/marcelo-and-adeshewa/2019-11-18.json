It's true it'd be limiting to have a portfolio of anime only, but if people can see that you can do other styles, it wouldn't be a problem, especially if your anime stuff is also good. Fundamental parts of drawing, colour and composition are there in every style, and this is what people are most interested to see. It's very rare you'd choose or use your own style on a commercial piece, series or film, so you usually need to be able to work with whatever style the job has.",
