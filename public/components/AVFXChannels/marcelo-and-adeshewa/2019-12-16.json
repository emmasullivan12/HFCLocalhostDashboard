I like the bouncy feeling given through squash and stretch techniques and the character design is pleasing to look at. I found my self laughing at Pony because of how odd it was :blush: You're really talented Marcelo! I'm sorry for the late responses, apparently my phone model doesn't allow Slack to send notifications so I have to keep manually checking which I sometimes forget to do :tired_face: I'll try my best to sort it out but I am wishing you a merry Christmas! :hugging_face:",
