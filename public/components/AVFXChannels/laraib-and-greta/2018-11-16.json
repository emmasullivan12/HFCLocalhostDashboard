But it is understandable that you are having difficulty to make a decision right now as your a beginner. As you mentioned you are passionate about compositing, I will suggest look more into it. When I started I was studying 2D and 3D and then I discovered getting into compositing was a little easier than 3D\/animation, so I chose composting and that is what I absolutely love doing now. So I believe if your passionate about compositing, pursue your career into it. You can always try different things later on if your not happy with that.",
