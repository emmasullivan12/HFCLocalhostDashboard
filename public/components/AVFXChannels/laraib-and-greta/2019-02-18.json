I started a new full time role in January for The Trampery as an assistant manager. I took on this role to gain more admin experience. However at the same time I’m still working on small freelance projects as well as personal projects. I’m currently looking in to going freelance full time and eventually starting my own business. I’d prefer to work as a freelancer full time with companies who will constantly need the some sort of multimedia seeing as I’m skilled in various areas. I’ve started speaking to the Princes Trust about business plans and what I need to consider before I go ahead with any decisions. I’ll probably start with this idea after this summer. ",
