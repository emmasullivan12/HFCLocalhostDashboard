And you never know you might enjoy it more than anything and pursued that as a proper career. Later if you do get any opportunity to try comping or grading try that as-well even if it’s for few days, but for now do what you think is easier to get in. Sometimes when you are actually working in a professional environment and show interest in different departments they might test you or give you a chance to try different things , then you will always learn what is best for you. I know professionals who have come from the managing backgrounds ending up doing compositing or vice versa. Also seen production managers getting into supervisor roles. Hope that helps. Good luck.",
