        "text": "So I graduated from Teesside university in 2016 and studied Computer Animation and Visual Effects. After graduating I thought I wanted to get in to teaching so I decided to work at Ada National College for Digital Skills for a year and realised that I would prefer to teach towards the end of my career. Currently I’m a runner at The Edit Store in central London and trying to find my next step in my career. At first I was very passionate about compositing and colour grading, which I still am, but as I’ve started to learn that there are so many options in terms of job roles in the industry, I’ve become a very open to most roles, even in admin and not just the creative roles but at the same time I feel overwhelmed by all the options. It’s also very difficult as a beginner to know where to start so I can have a stable career. I hope this makes sense ",
