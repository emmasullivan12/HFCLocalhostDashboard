In saying that, I would also like to mention that being a runner is a very insightful job, however, it doesn't pay the bills as its a minimum wage job, unfortunately.  I'm considering to find an admin based job withing post-production, as I have previous experience in this, for the time being until I am able to progress on to a job that can lead to compositing. Do you think this would be a wiser alternative for someone like myself who would like to ultimately work in compositing in the long run?",
