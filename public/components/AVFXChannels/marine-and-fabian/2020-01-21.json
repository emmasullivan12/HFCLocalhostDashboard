It can feel very lonely, and I completely understand your frustration but it is fairly normal when you start. Do not give up and keep reapplying, hopefully create new material and try building networks on LinkedIn too. It sometimes takes time, it could be because of a downturn in the industry in Vancouver, a tax break loophole closing etc .... it's very difficult to know. It doesn't mean that you should lose heart or that your work is not good enough!",

I would keep it simple and give time to the viewer to really see what you have done. Why not have several reels, one snappy one like this and a more traditional one where your work can be seen for longer, in more detail? I'm sure you have plenty of renders to do this.",
