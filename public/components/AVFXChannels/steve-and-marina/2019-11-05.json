With the height the ball has at the start and the following bounce heights it's a little odd that it lands and rolls as soon as it does.\nSo you have two option.\n1 - You can lower the height of the other bounces to be quite low.\n2 - You can add in a few more bounces.",

If you do this it's the top of the arcs that need more time. We call this \"hang time\". So you ball would need more hang time at the top. The sharp tangents at the bottom of the arcs will need to be pretty much the same as it will still hit the round and bounce off quickly like it does at the moment.",

        "text": "2 - You will need to translate the ball further  to give it more space to bounce in. Basically just repeat what you have done but with the height of the ball gradually slower until it's pretty much landed. Then you can roll it. I think for this option you probably need two more bounces. Don't forget that the less energy the ball has the less high it will jump. Less energy also means that the point from each contact with the floor will be closer together in time. For example; your first two contacts are at f8 and f16. A difference of 8 frames. Your third bounce happens at f23 which is 7 frames difference. So you fourth and fifth bounces will need to be around 6 and 5 frames difference.",
