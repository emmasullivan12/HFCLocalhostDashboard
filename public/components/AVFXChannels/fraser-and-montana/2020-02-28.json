I would be well up for giving you any critique on your comps if you want to hear from me on that, and also in terms of what to build within your showreel for compositing work. As you say, the reel is varied. I think companies want to see specialist work and even in terms of 3D generalisation, it doesn't quite put that across yet anyway. So, I'd definitely be up for helping you build a compositing reel if you wanted to build something more specialist for VFX work. That doesn't mean you can't also build an animation or modeling reel or whatever later, but to get a foot in the door in VFX, a specialist reel will be helpful in my opinion and considering that you mentioned enjoying the compositing process I think it'd be a good way to go. Would you be interested in that? Also, have you done much rotoscoping or cleanup work before?",
