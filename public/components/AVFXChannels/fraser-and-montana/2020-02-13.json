        "text": "Hi Fraser, Im Montana, really excited to be talking with you. I’m still kind of new to all this but I’ll quickly say a bit about myself. So I graduated 2 and a half years ago from uni with a degree in animation production. But it’s only this year that I’ve finally been able to get back into anything creative and being able to apply for jobs. Which have been very deflating. \n\nI’ve always assumed the ‘3D Generalist’ role but I’m not even sure if I fall under that banner, as when people see my portfolio they say it’s quite varied, compositing, modelling, 2D, VFX. So they don’t often know where to place me. The problem is I enjoy a lot of different aspects in animation and VFX. I talked with someone in the industry a few weeks back and she said I needed to find a focus and suggested going for runner roles If I was having trouble figuring out what exactly I’d like to do within the industry. While the pay isn’t great, It’s actually exciting for me because I might finally be able to focus on one thing as opposed to my ‘jack of all trades’ syndrome. The problem I’m having though is figuring out how to address the ‘cover letter’ aspect as I’ve either been getting rejected or just not hearing back at all. And I’d just really love to get my foot in the door. Just seems like I’m not going about it the right way to even be given the chance. So any advice would be helpful :relaxed: sorry for the long message btw. :see_no_evil:",
