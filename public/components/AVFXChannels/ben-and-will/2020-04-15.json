For our project at home, we are using Nuke to add, remove and rebuild the scene in a way that we want. It’s only a 4 week project so it’s really just to play around and get to grips with it, which is what I’ve been doing. I have a iMac at home which is pretty decent and can run what I need it to run fairly well and we’ve only been given trial licenses, which isn’t the best!",
