I've been assigned as your mentor :raised_hands: :smile:\n\nAny questions you have let me know and I'll do my best to help you.\n\nI see you're interested in computing. I'm working on the build of our Prospela web &amp; app platforms. So hopefully I can shed some light on these areas for you!\n\nIt would be great to hear a bit about your interests and what you would like support with over the duration of this mentoring programme (approx. 2 months).",
