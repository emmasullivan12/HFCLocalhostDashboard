Are you going to be looking for work experience and doing a CV\/personal statement etc? I'm happy to help and take a look at your drafts for you now? \n\nDo you also have an idea of what skills you need to be building to be attractive for a PhD and employers in computer science? I can help you figure this out too if you are unsure. One of the big regrets  we hear from a lot of our mentors and professionals whatever career they go into, is that they focused solely on their grades and didn't start developing attractive \/ useful skills whilst they were at school.
