On occasion such labs accept people who only have master’s degrees, but this is extremely rare. A CS PhD also gives you an advantage for some quantitative finance positions, assuming your PhD is mathematical and algorithmic in nature. For some companies (typically larger ones), having a CSContinue reading...",
