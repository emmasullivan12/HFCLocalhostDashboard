The responsibility on launching is mainly on the marketing team but we could not do it without the finance, sales, category and development teams. For a blog, the biggest tip I could give you is to never give up, they are a slow start up but once you have a following this gives you a lot of routes to take, as I'm sure you are aware blogging is now a huge area of marketing spend with many companies paying the influencers to blog\/ vlog about their products, determination is key in the first few months of blogging, just stick at it and you will be fine! What type of blog are you looking to start? #curiosity ",
