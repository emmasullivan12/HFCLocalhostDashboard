That's gotten me a lot of respect from senior people. Obviously I have to be respectful, but most people in my industry realise that argument is the best way to get to a good case to present in court, so it gets me a long way. The same would be true in the legal world. Using that at work - I just argue a lot. Most recently in my meeting on Monday, presenting to the CEO and the rest of the board of my client in Algeria, I was arguing why they should accept as true something that they are famous of not believing (that was actually mentioned in one of the presentations at the conference today).

Probably the thing I find most challenging is dealing with people who either don't like arguing or who just don't understand the argument. While most of the people I deal with are very intelligent, some have been promoted too far, so it can be a real challenge having to balance the need to be correct and the need to not annoy a client too much. I had a lot of difficulty early in my career hiding it if I thought my client wasn't as smart as they should be, which I think I have managed to deal with now.",
