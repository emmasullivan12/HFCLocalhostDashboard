Being able to see many sides of a story, helps with law especially in order to make your statement and having to be able to be critical and up for debate, believing that your side is going to win. It also enriches my wider knowledge of past events that have taken place, American history being one of my favourite topics. Do you have any particular historical moments that interest you? ",

Which is exactly what law is (or at least the law that I work with). Being critical about sources and ideas is one of the most important things in my job - we do actually have a history graduate in my office. History that interests me - again, I have a wide range. I actually started \"The Earth is Weeping\" on the plane today, a new history of the American war for the West, I find the history of how Americans treated the indigenous population fascinating and very disturbing. I'm very interested in Mongol history, mainly because of a podcast series on it. \"Hardcore History\" is worth a listen if you don;t already know it, he goes very very in depth on a particular part of history. His Mongol series was very good. Probably the history I read the most about is the Enlightenment - I'm really interested in how people Western Europe broke away from entrenched ways of thinking and how they framed ideas of truth and science, and broke away from \"divine right\" theories of monarchy.",
