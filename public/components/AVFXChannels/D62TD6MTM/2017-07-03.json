I aspire to become a lawyer one day and heard you work in the legal profession. I have a list of Q's for you if you don't mind answering in your free time:\n1. What does a typical working day look like for you?\n2. Which university did you attend?\n3. What is your role in the legal sector?\n4. What's the best part of working in the legal sector? \n5. What's the hardest part of your job? \n(I also heard you love books, so what are some of your favourite books?) \nHope to hear from you soon",

I also love the pressure of arbitration - during the hearing itself (the end of a couple of years work, lasting a week or so) we will generally be working 16-18 hours a day, very intense intellectually, lots of think an challenging each others ideas and working out strategy for the rest of the hearing.

The greatest book written is a tie between Lord of the Rings, The Count of Monte Christo, and Middlemarch (I wrote a dissertation on the philosophy of George Eliot, so am a big fan of her. Scenes of Clerical Life, her first book, is always worth a read). Other favourites are Somerset Maugham - \"Painted Veil\" and \"On Human Bondage\" are great examples of simple yet incredibly effective writing. I also love Russian literature, and finally finished War and Peace, which is incredible if the length doesn;t put you off. History - Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is incredible - a revisionist take on American history, but important nonetheless. Books is something I could talk about all day, so I will stop there. What are your favourites?",
