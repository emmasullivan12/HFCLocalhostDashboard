I cannot work on unlimited channels unfortunately, it's too risky... however I'm willing to try to help you because you have a very special project, and also because I think the load (nb of messages in each channel) will be limited. I suggest we try a setup with 75â‚¬\/month, for 150 shared channels. That should cover a good chunk of your initial phase, and if things go well for you we can rediscuss",
