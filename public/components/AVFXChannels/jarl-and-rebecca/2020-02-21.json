It must have taught you a lot in such a short space of time moving from vfx to animation!\n\nI got interested in 3D modelling first, just by looking at 3D and VFX artists online such as Andreas Wannderstedt and I was lucky enough to be able to take a UAL interactive media diploma at college, I got to use Maya and a wide variety of other 3d\/games related units as well as some design ones. It felt like the natural next step was to create characters in 3D and\/or animate them to tell stories",
