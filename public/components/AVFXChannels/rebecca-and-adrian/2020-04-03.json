Pretty much what I’m into to- although I work at BZ with a lot more kid friendly\/stylised work- it’s mainly modelling that’s stylised - our shaders tend to be done to match real life references :) \n\nSo I have a weird back story! I originally studied Biomedical Science with Pathology and switched to a animation degree. It wasn’t a great uni so I was super lucky to know a lot of people and get feedback and advice from them.\n\nMy uni has a placement year- the scene in Belfast was big for 2d productions and I was a production coordinator\/generalist in house for a year \nI was lucky to go back their after graduating to act as a generalist on a Cartoon Forum pilot - which help bulked out my reel\nMy boyfriend is a groom artist at MPC so I knew a lot of his friends and I’m a big networker so I know people all over the world industry wise (which surprises a lot of people :joy:) and then I was recommended for a production assistant job there- were I worked with a great team \nI love the people there and although a lot of people have moved on we still keep in touch (we have been holding a Friday night VFX pub through Zoom which has been amazing)\nAfter that I interviewed for blue zoo and have been working there from January :) \n\nIn all honesty it’s been terrifying - I had a 12 week contract at MPC before the “purge” and redundancies and had to act quickly to get another job \n\nThe industry hasn’t been stable for the last year and the competition is huge! That’s why I like companies like blue zoo where they treat people well\n\nMy boyfriend has worked at mpc for nearly 3 years now and he’s had a great experience there- they sent him to Bangalore and Montreal to train staff- and have moved him to previs to ensure he had a secure enough job when they were not renewing contracts at Christmas time \n",

I'm working with a mate who's doing the groom. Texturing and Lookdev isn't my strongest avenue but I don't think i'm terrible haha\nWhat made you want to switch from bio science to animation? They're both quite different disciplines :open_mouth:\nYeah its definitely nice to know that being in this industry, artists seem to know everyone  from everywhere The community seems very friendly and supportive which is nice\nYeah from word of mouth I heard MPCs kinda not the best when it comes to contracts haha though I really wanna work there some day :joy: Given such short contracts seems like such a scary thing :sweat_smile:\nI seem to get the impression that smaller companies are a lot nicer to their artists but idk\nAh its cool you've worked at big and small companies.

For me moving from the smaller companies in Belfast was because I wasted to learn more and work with a lead who had experience - like I’m already finding I’m solving problems I would never have been able to before\n\nLike MPC has some bad rep- but the people who work there were fantastic and it by far was my favourite in terms of people and personalities \n\nNice!
