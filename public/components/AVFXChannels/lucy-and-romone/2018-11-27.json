If your school do computer classes that’d be helpful too.\n\nShe also recommends learning any animation software - some of these you can get for free, like 'Blender' or a student version of Maya.\n\nTwo great books to read are:\n•\t'Illusion of Life' by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and\n•\t'Animator's Survival Kit' by Richard Williams\n\nIn the future when you’re starting to think about finishing school there are online animation courses that you can apply to, if you google ‘online animation courses’ you can start to have a look at what’s out there. Some of these are just as good as our UK universities.",
