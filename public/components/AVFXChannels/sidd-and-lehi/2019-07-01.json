So I know you've had a little background on me from my application right? I'm very interested in continuing with 3D character animation and I also do creature related stuff. So I'm looking to improve as much as I can there. I'm interested in both kids TV and VFX so I'm building reels for both. I'm generally confident in my acting choices but I've generally got a way to go",
