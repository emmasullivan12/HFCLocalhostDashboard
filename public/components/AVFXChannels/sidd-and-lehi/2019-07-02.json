I'm usually quite busy during the working week so it _might_ take me a while to reply, but i'll definitely get back to you that much I can guarantee!\nYep I got the profile, glad to hear that you're interested in pursuing 3D animation :relaxed:! Also no worries Lehi, this is my first shot at being a Mentor so forgive me if I try and throw too much advice your way (only if you ask for it :grin:)\nWell first off you're definitely doing yourself a massive favour taking acting classes, it'll reeeally help you push your character animation skills to the next level. Also props to doing improv because I find that very tricky haha. Do you have any other skills that you'd like to work on for your portfolio?\n\nAs for what i'm doing, conveniently enough my studio is working on a pilot for a children's TV show at the moment! The project is interesting because we're animating 2D planes in a 3D environment (think Paper Mario and South Park). It's super interesting working on this because it's drawing on (in my opinion) the best of both 2D and 3D animation :relaxed: I'll talk about it in detail later, don't want to overload you with too much in one message!",
