Maybe have it sweep a bit lower down to the piers, so you can show off your modelling a bit bigger on screen. Other than that I think it’s looking really cool!\n\nAnd yeah sure!

How would I go about doing that just because I don't have a drone to refilm. Would I need to create the ocean in VFX so that I can just change the camera path in 3D for perspective change rather than a camera Projection?\n\nThat's awesome! Makes me wanna watch dark crystal haha! Yeah don't worry I won't share it. I just like looking at peoples reels for inspiration haha",
