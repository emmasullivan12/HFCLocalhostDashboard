The way I've approached it is using a difference matte by grabbing a plate and using that.\n\nI've fiddled with the difference matte as best I could and it's okay at best so I've roto'd the head &amp; neck (only 25 frames this time haha) to clean those parts up... \n\nNow using the open spline tool for the individual outlying hairs to clean them up a bit. \n\nJust wondering, how do you approach hair for roto? If there's no green screen",
