Yeah that's true if it helps to show an understanding of different departments then that's a bonus I guess! :laughing:\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/d9C038rTgQA>\nThis is a really quick layout shows the piers in there, no textures just to save time, smoke in the background I want it to be all where the one element is now.\n\nOn the beach the bit of smoke at the start is the start of a sim I was doing yesterday, I was thinking of having some sort of oil stockpiles burning there or something. But will have a few in different locations. I feel like the tracking is alright so far.\n\nOh nice that's good to know then cheers! Could I have a look at your reel if you wouldn't mind?",
