I would say they both sound pretty cool and a lot of opportunity for learning some cool techniques! I guess it boils down to if you want to learn a particular technique in a software. \n\nIdea 1 sounds like it’s a fair bit of matte painting with the beacons and the army and stuff. A lot of pictures projected in 3D to get nice perspective and stuff \n\nOr idea 2 sounds like a keying (I guess you would film a dude falling?), and some modelling and simulation for the stuff falling. \n\nIf it was me doing a module like this I would be probably using it as an opportunity to really learn a particular technique \/ get a really solid showreel shot\/sequence. \n\nWe did a similar module at uni and they taught us to try and nail 1 or a couple is techniques rather than trying to do shit loads.\n\nHow long have you got to get it done? \n\nIs there a particular thing you have seen in a movie or show that you could do your own version of?",
