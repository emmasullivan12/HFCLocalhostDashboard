Then I draw my roto shape in the roto node.  The area inside the roto shape will then be multiplied by 0 and thus will not be there when it gets merged over. You can also invert the roto pope if the shape would be massive. Does that make sense? Feel free to send me the script if you want any pointers on how I would tackle it!\n\nWith Nuke there is a million and 1 ways to do everything so it’s just all about knowing the right workflow to use for the situation you’ve got",
