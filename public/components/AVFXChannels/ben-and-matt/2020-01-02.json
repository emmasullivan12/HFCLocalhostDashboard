Where as, if you take a look at this video, (god knows what this guy is on about...) <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HQZqbGME5HY> you can see the flicker feels a bit 'slower'\n\nHow are creating the effect?",

I thought it was too fast but by the time it had finished I just thought can I get away with it to save time :joy:\n\nUsing PheonixFD for the fire and just a light with a noise modifier for the lighting. Can easily change the frequency change down a bit to slow the rate of the flickering down. It's just rendering slows everything else down on my poor laptop :joy:\n\nFor the fire I was thinking I could replace the fire from pheonix with some stock footage to solve that luminance issue and to add a bit more of a realistic look to it.",
