        "text": "Hey dude, at DNEG AE is only really used by our motion graphics team. In terms of compositing it is all Nuke really. Itâ€™s the same story for most big film and tv places to be honest. The node based workflow means we can address notes faste and shots can be handed round people if needs be (although they like to avoid that if possible)\n\nI would say picking up Nuke is the way forward right now to get into the industry. While AE will be good at training your eye, learning how to achieve what you want in Nuke would be more beneficial I reckon.\n\nOn a more broad sense I think bode based workflows are where the industry is heading. More and more of our CG is coming from Houdini (although Maya is still DNEGs primary 3D package) which is also node based.",

Think the only reason I've been using Ae is the price &amp; Andrew Kramers tutorials :joy: but yeah, got a student nuke licence last week so been getting a feel around for it and stuff. \n\nFor a full camera tracking, do you primarily use the built in nuke camera tracker? Or 3rd party like SynthEyes\/ pftrack? \n\nAm I alright to quote what you said ^^ about nuke &amp; nodes in general?",
