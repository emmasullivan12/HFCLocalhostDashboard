Yeah I can imagine it must be tough, especially starting a new place, home is usually the safe place where you can just relax and not have to focus on anything. Plus I guess your probably pretty tempted to just do a little bit more or whatever so it starts to eat up more of your life :thumbsdown:. Just gotta stay positive mate, if you can get through working like this, then when it all blows over, it's just something to look forward too!\nI actually had the regular flu last week and was shitting it thinking I had Covid haha :laughing:. We're working from home now, I'm just looking at it from the perspective of I'm saving money from travelling...\nWe're using Microsoft Teams to have virtual lessons, but they're more aimed at the first years. There's talk of moving the deadlines forward and just handing everything in early and calling it a day.. but I'm not entirely sure if that helps anyone, since it's all digital hand in only anyway... :eyes::laughing:",
