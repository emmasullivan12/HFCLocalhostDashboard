If you send me a still frame of your CG I can do a spimple set up for how I would try and tackle it if you like?\n\nWith stuff like this I would always try and spend half an hour to an hour in 2D jus seeing if I can get something that is sort of working rather than diving straight into 3D. If you find a solution that works then happy days, and if not, then its only an hour or so wasted. Where as 3D is much more complex and takes a bit more time to get stuff working. (But I am a comper so I am always going to want to try and solve it in 2D where I fee more comfortable :wink:)",
