TBH I haven’t found it very easy to transition to working from home, I usually like to keep work and home separate if I can (otherwise I just keep thinking about work the entire time) so having them forced to gether has been tough. With that along with the normal pressures of starting at a new place its been a bit down for the last week. Everyone at Automatik has been super great and helpful its just taking me a while to get comfortable given the circumstances. How are you doing? Whats the situation with uni?",
