Really good idea to show off you tracking skills aswell as the modelling of the pier and stuff you have already done.\nThe cleanup of the people on the beach will also be really good practice and can show off you have an understanding of how each department works, even if you only want a job in one :wink:\nYeah defo send me anything you've got!\nAnd yeah like I know how easy it is to get carried away especially when you see so much awesome VFX every day, but the best thing to do is to pair it back and try and nail a couple of things, thats the best way to get noticed. Its all about quality not quantity when it comes to work on a showreel. The reel I put together for Automatik was like 50 seconds and was anly the best shots I have worked on over the past few years.",
