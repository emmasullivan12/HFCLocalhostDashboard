The book is like suuuuuper detailed but it has some good pointers for starting off.\nYeah the weather has been super intense right! Let me know if you want any advice in term of planning your shoot!",

Haha\n\nCan't wait to watch it see how it all looks!\n\n\nYeah, how would you plan a shot out? \n\nI've made this in 3D it's basically a first person shooter, set in ww2, the camera is a soldier. \n\nThe orange box's are sand dunes the purple box's are the enemy soldiers who get shot by the camera guy and his buddies. Then the falling box's at the end are bombs.\nIt's just a really quick draft for the planning.\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/nKNIRAoa3Q4|https:\/\/youtu.be\/nKNIRAoa3Q4>\n\nThen I've got a horse scene which is primarily half of a horse's head then gonna extend the shot with a 3D version of some stables which I'm gonna light on fire. I've not uploaded the draft for that but will do in a couple of days (just away in Birmingham celebrating 5 years with the missus).\n\nThen the other is an evacuation, based on Dunkirk, I've only really planned on the 3D model placement so far but it's just a still camera like the horse one.",

I spent such a long time working on it, like over a year, so to see it come out was such a relief and everything came together really well I think :stuck_out_tongue:\n\nThe animatic looks good for the FPS shot. I think there is some nice room for some really nice ways for you to show off what you know in a showreel too!\n\nAre these all one part of one project or are you gonna choose one and then do it?\n\nAll sounds cool though!\n\nAs for moving, it was a number of things really. I have been at Dneg my entire career and have always wanted to move around a bit. Also in the TV department there has been some changes with the way we work that makes it a different place to work. Plus, unfortunately, in VFX its easier to boost your pay packet if you move around a bit. I have always wanted to work at a smaller place for a little while and when I went for an interview I got a really good vibe.",

I kind of wanted to do something taking inspiration from 1917 with it all in one take or seamlessly blending one shot to another, because I just think it's amazing that, but maybe I'll work on something like that after I finished at uni haha\n\nThat's fair enough plus I guess you get to meet all kinds of different people too.
