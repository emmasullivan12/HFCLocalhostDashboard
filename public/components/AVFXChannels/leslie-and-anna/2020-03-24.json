Short contracts can be tiring but it's a good way to let those studios and people know more about you and your work ethic. It might take a while but it will be useful in the future.\n\nCongrats on the work visa, you are correct Montreal and Vancouver are big industry hubs, especially Montreal in the past 2 years. Unfortunately all studios have slowed down drastically on hiring due to the pandemic but hopefully things ease up in the following months. Otherwise getting work here is pretty straightforward with a visa, it's all about the reel!",
