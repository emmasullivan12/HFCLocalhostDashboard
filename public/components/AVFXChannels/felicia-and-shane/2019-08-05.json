I hope that I can provide the suport that you're looking for and I'm happy to answer any question about anything and everything. I'm in the middle of a move right now so might be a bit irregular in my answers, but I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can. \nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

Im moving in 4 weeks too and buying a decent PC to focus on upskilling in my spare time. Managed to get a good deal on a nuke license from the foundry so no excuses now :stuck_out_tongue:.                                                                  I guess to get the ball rolling I'd like to know what are your key tasks as a junior comper  in your current job and what aspects did you find most challenging when learning these skills.   My last 18 months of compositing (again very basic) have been on Kids TV mixed media cartoons so I assume our pipelines are quite different.                                                                    No need to rush to reply. Best of luck with the move!!!",
