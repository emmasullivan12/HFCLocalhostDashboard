My favourite is and ibk base and then keylight for hair and stuff. I wish there was just one track for it, but different cameras, lighting, screens etc makes every shot so different. But I rely pretty heavily on additive keyers, they can save you quite a bit when it comes to motion blur as well. As well as always trying to bring back the original grain when you can, theres usually a lot of detail in that and will help you sell it.",
