I do the basics like keying and cleanup, but also everything from cg comp to beauty work. I jump around a lot and some days I do roto and some days I comp here shots. The companies I've worked at have always been on the smaller side, I've seen this as a positive because I haven't been stuck in one type of work, I've been able to jump around and try a little bit of everything. \nWhen I started out I would mostly do cleanup, it's a great way to practice a lot of disciplines (roto, mathmove, etc) but also prove to new supervisors that you're capable. As they grew more confident in me I got more and more complex shots, first it was just matching to hero shots done by a senior but then I started doing them as well along with entire sequences. I'd say cleanup is the best thing to practice, get your technical skills up, its not very creative, but it's good because its blending everything to the plate trains your eye to see what belongs in the plate\/what does not and why. This is something you'll need when some of the \"cooler\" and more creative shots starts coming",
