But here's some basic tips that helps a lot. \nAlways keep an eye on your bounding box, it can slow you down a lot and ruin your renders. When I got the time to be tidy I usually set the merge node \"set bbox to\" B. Or just keep on top with your crops. \nNuke really doesn't like certain formats, try to avoid tifs and ps files for example. \nUtilize the downsrez and area selection in your viewer. You dont always need to process the full image. \nPrecomp heavy nodes \nMotionBlur can be super heavy, turn it off when you're working \nThat's just some very general basic tips, I hope its somewhat useful!",
