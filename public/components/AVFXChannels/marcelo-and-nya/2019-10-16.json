I'll try and answer you as well as I can based on my experiences, but if we come across some subject I'm not well aware I can search some resources for you to look into.\nIt's been only 3 months I'm working in the UK, before that I had been living and working in Brazil, where I'm from. I have worked on several stages of animation productions, but especially with storyboards and 2d traditional and cut out animation.",
