There's so much to learn, and there's definitely not just one way of doing things, so you can keep learning and experimenting as you go.\nIt's not easy as a career in terms of stability and continuity of work and income, even if you work permanent of fixed term contract, and that's worldwide. It certainly doesn't compare to people who happen to get some job in well stabilished company and they might work there their whole lives and move upwards in a clear career path. But I assume the kind of work you'd do also doesn't compare. What I know for experience is that you've got to really like it as a thing for your life and day to day. You'll be in a studio or at home working with animation for at least 8 hours of your day, dealing with people who do animation. You must like it as something you'd want to be part for most of your life",
