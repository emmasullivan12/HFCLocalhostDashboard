I started my career in post production, but then transitioned into visualisation in pre-production as we do actually use a lot of the same software and tools.\n\nHave you used any of the software associated with post production much? Eg Maya, Nuke, etc? And has there been any part of the post production work flow that you’ve found particularly interesting?",
