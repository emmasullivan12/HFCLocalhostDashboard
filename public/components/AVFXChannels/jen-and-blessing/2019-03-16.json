(There is also postvis, techvis, pitchvis).\n\nIf you don’t know what Previs is (most people haven’t heard of it), then let me explain:\n\nIt’s like the next step on from storyboarding. We create a CG animated version of the sequence before they shoot it. So it enables the director to try out different ideas and really hone the sequence before they shoot it. Then the previs is used as a guide on set. The sequences we work on tend to be the big VFX-heavy sequences.\n\nCould you tell me a little about yourself and what ideas you have for your future?",
