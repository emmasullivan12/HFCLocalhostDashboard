        "text": "No problem. Cool let's start by exploring Accounting then!\n\n*Essentially every business needs an Accountant* to ensure their finances are in order (and accurate, which is a legal obligation), as well as optimized e.g. to ensure they aren't paying too much or too little tax, and to report numbers to Senior Management to help them make the best decisions in running the business.\n\nLarger companies (such as Tesco, BP, etc.) will have their own in-house Accountancy teams to do this work (but still might use external Accountancy companies to do other financey tasks), whereas slightly smaller companies might \"outsource\" this to an Accountancy company to just do the work a couple of times a year.\n\nThese Accountancy companies can vary in size from \"The Big Four\" (i.e. the largest Accountancy companies in the World are called EY, Deloitte, KPMG, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers\/PwC) to a small accountancy company on the high street that will work with small businesses.\n\nSo as an Accountant you probably want to aspire to work in The Big Four or in-house at a large corporate (such as Tesco, BP etc), as that is where the money\/training\/good reputation is! Indeed lots of these companies will do apprenticeships\/work experience\/insight days, but to start with you would still learn something from the local Accountancy companies on your local high street for example",
