Is it just school work you have on or extracurricular things too? \nOne thing I'd say is do as much work as possible as soon as you get it so it doesn't snowball into a big pile. Also try doing your hardest subjects first and then leaving the ones you find easiest for when you're tired; that should reduce the amount of time it takes to get through it all.\nYou can make a timetable if necessary but that's tricky if you're not sure how long work is going to take. Work for 50 minutes every hour and then reward yourself with a snack or ten minutes on your phone or whatever and set an alarm so you're back to work ten minutes later",
