Do you have any work experience that's science related or do you know anyone who works in a science field? \nI'm the exact opposite to you! I like English and languages and history. I did English at uni and then tested several different things to find a job I really liked. I'm now training to be a primary school teacher, so I spend four days a week in a school and then go to UCL for training on Fridays. I was worried about the couple of years I feel I wasted but now I'm enjoying it so much that I'm glad I took the time to find something that's right for me, so that's something I'd advise: don't worry about the timeline so much as getting to your eventual goal",
