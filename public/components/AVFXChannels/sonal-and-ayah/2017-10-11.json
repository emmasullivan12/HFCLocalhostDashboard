I would love to hear about what you do currently and how you managed to get there. \nI am currently in year 12 studying biology , chemistry and geography at Villiers high school . One of my personal interests is science especially biology ( I really enjoyed it at high school ) . In the future I would like to go into the field of science but I'm not too sure what exactly I want to do.  Personally I'm a very  bubbly person however when I have a set aim , I would do my best to achieve it.\n",
