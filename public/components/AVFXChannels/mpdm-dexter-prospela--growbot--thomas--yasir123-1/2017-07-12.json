I would suggest having a look at property week and estates gazette to see what is currently going on in the real estate world at the moment. The summer is normally a lot quieter in the industry however with everything that has been going on with the recent EU referendum and the UK election there is a lot of volatility in what people want to do. \nThe property industry gets a lot of bad press as they see it as an industry where developers are making money at others expense however there are a lot of companies that are trying to change that image!",
