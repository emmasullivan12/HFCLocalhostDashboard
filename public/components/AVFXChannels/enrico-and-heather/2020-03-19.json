I’ve recently finished to work on a 2D tv serie at Blue Zoo in London as Environment Designer (basically I draw all the locations and some props). I mostly focus on 2D design but during the production of the show I was provided with 3D models from Sketchup to speedup the production. I’m also pushing my skills on ZBrush, so I can block basic shapes for my environment and have different angles for the same location. What about yourself? :)",

I'm a freelancer based in Manchester, I used to work in VFX in London. I'm trying to move into concept art as a full time role and wanted some help getting there which is why I signed up for this! I've worked on a few things as a freelancer, tv series and animation for a little bit. But I'd really like to move into concept art\/visual development full-time, hopefully in games as that seems to be the predominant industry up here in the North. I've built an art portfolio on the side ever since I was working in London, I keep adding to it when I can ( a lot more time now the COVID-19 thing has escalated!) that's really interesting you're pushing in ZBrush, I've used it myself a little but never for anything hard surface, it's always been really organic things.",
