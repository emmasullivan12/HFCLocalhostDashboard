I was looking to move into Matte Painting and Concept Art which unfortunately was taking too long in such a big studio. I wasn't getting any opportunities to progress, so I decided to move back closer to my family but also to a city that had a good creative industry too. I've been doing all sorts since then, working as a matte painter\/compositor as well as doing some concept art as well :slightly_smiling_face: Because of this I don't really have a specialism in terms of \"style\" I have Photoreal work as well as more stylised illustration in my portfolio! I'll pop you the link below for you to have a look through :slightly_smiling_face: it's true, as unfortunate as this whole situation is some of the positives are that we can all focus more on ourselves and build our skills, as well as companies having to seriously consider the remote working! Which do you prefer working on out of organic or hard surface? I find I much prefer organic things! I can't seem to find the inspiration\/creativity for the hard surface designs so much!",

        "text": "Hi Sam! That’s really cool! Yes it’s not easy to progress in big companies sometimes, and is good you move onto something you prefer! Sometimes smallest places\/ companies give you more opportunity to experiment and try! I think is good to be versatile , there’s no need to have a specific one, but also it depends if what you want to do and prefer. I do prefer organic surfaces as well, I want to add some hard surfaces but in a cartoony way so the shapes of the props are more soft, interesting and fun to do! Personally I don’t want to go towards realism. I have a look now thanks for the link!!",
