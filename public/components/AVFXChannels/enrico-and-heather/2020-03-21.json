To improve on characters I would suggest you to do an exercise:  start painting from a photographic reference  as a study ( portrait) then making a caricature of it. In this way you’re basically adding a comedy\/ irony to your subject, and pushing shapes. After that, you take the same caricature and start developing a cartoony character pushing shapes even more and simplifying the shapes even more! At this point you have a character for animation with personality cause you started from a reference, and of course you can add details. As final thing you can try to make a turn around ",
