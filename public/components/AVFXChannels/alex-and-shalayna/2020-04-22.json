How are you?\n\nJust in case - I'm most likely will be able to reply in bursts rather than \"live\".\n\nA bit about myself - I've been in the industry for around 8-9 years now. I started as a generalist\/modeler then slowly transitioned into lighting\/lookdev. I had opportunity to be a lead as well as supervise some projects in the recent years. I mostly worked in films but I had some great time working on game cinematics\/high end commercials too. At the moment I do lighting and lookdev at Framestore and I'll be happy to answer all your questions and provide you with feedback if you'll need any.",
