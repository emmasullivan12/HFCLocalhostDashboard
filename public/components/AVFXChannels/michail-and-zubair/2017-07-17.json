He then bounced around jobs all around the country from factory worker to bus driver. It was through the latter that he met someone who mentioned that the council were looking for workers. He then applied and got in, as not many people applied, doing admin. And after a few years of being curious, he managed to bag a role in the accounting department even though he knew jack about working with numbers. From here, they paid to send him to do AAT, as at this point, there weren't many people actuall qualified to do the role. It turned out that my dad was really good at it, excelling in every exam which resulted in him getting a good position. From then on, he continued to grow and so worked in the council for 20+ years, which resulted in him being allowed to retire 3 years ago at the age of 53. In the end, my dad didnt get his big break till he was in his late 20s\/early 30s.",
