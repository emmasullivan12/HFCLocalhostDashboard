At A-level, i Was 5 marks off a B (If i had got this, i feel my life would have changed completely as i would have been available for more positions. instead, I got 3 C's in computing and physics). Anyways, After college, i knew university wasn't for me so i looked for apprenticeships. After many interviews for a whole range or roles, i Ultimately took a reality check and did an IT apprenticeship at a local school earning apprentice minimum wage. Whilst here, I got an idea that maybe IT wasnt for me, atleast this side of it as i was more into coding.  More importanly though, i got experience, which is what stopped me from getting the job in previous interviews. or so they say, but in reality, it was just an easier way of saying we dont want you.",

Nearly 2 years later and i'm still here but with a somewhat clear idea that the financial world is what i want to go in. I was very interested in Actuarial but to start that apprenticeship, you needed a B in maths, minimum :upside_down_face: So that left me with accounting. Now my father was an accountant for the council years ago, and he got to it through luck and hard work and so he's made a good career out of himself. Times have changed now, meaning its a lot harder, but I still feel its a good profession to get into.",

Now, if this was closer to home, id be over the moon with the job, especially since i've been rejected countless amount of times, but now i'm having doubts. Like, is AAT something I really want to do? is accounting in general something i could see myself doing? How hard is it for someone of my level?

And today, i got the outcome which was, you guessed it, failed. Again. I'm really interested in Cima more as its supposed to be easier + theres good career prospects. But applying for somethign like this, it means I can target a specific qualification and complete it fully within 4\/5 years as opposed to doing AAT over 3 years then spending another 3 (?) years achieving CIMA.
