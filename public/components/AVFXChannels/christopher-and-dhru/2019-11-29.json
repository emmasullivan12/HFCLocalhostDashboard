I have models that i've created over the past few years but want to add fx to them in houdini but am unsure if the models have to be made a certain way in order for them to work in houdini?",

Usually, geometry is separated into its parts if it either needs to be blown off or otherwise come apart from another piece. Or if it's going to be shaded differently\/have a different material. Separating makes all this much easier and also insures that IF you take parts off, the parts that remain don't need any extra work to close off any holes left over from any separating action. Does that make sense? Not the easiest to explain in just words :wink:",
