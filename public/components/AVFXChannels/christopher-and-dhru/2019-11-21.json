I started out studying media technology in a university but that turned out very dry and theoretical so i focussed on some projects that people worked on on the side or trying out things on my own (and eventually dropped out in favour of trying a few freelance gigs). From there i went to a small vfx-company for an internship and then basically being a generalist for a few years (focussing on fx-&gt;lighting-&gt;comp stuff since i had no interest in modelling\/anim etc :wink:)…which was a really good learning experience, tho, since we worked on a new&amp;different problem every 2 weeks or so, so we all got to try and learned a lot at that place. Eventually that job went a bit stale, though and i wanted to try “bigger things”, lucked out on a few early smaller\/local film jobs that i could show my “talents” on and then fell into the big vfx movie machine where i’ve been working round-the-world now for the last 11-12 years :slightly_smiling_face:. I think fx is a cool field to be in, since it can encompass so many different fields in it at least a little bit.\nThat’s kinda it :slightly_smiling_face: . What made you jump on fx as thing you wanna study?",

We basically need to know about everything coming in (is the anim done in the right way? is the track off, so our elements will be off, too? etc) and similarly about our output - lighting needs certain attributes to make their shaders work or some companies even have fx light their elements themselves. we often (slap)comp our elements for at least presentation or to present a certain look if it’s another magical element that no one knows what it’ll look like :wink:  - so we need to know about that stuff too. This has shifted a bit over time as other departments need to get more generalist and obviously i’m biased, but i think fx is still the most generalist. So yeah, it definitely helps being more generalist…but not at all necessary. There’s quite a lot diversity in the fx-things that people specialize in (like i’m not super interested in heavy scripting, but there are other people that are, so i can rely on them to help me\/the team out)\nAll of that doesn’t mean you “need” to start out a generalist as you can easily pick that up later on as you work on projects",
