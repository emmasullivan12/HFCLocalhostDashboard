What helps me and seems to be a common approach for fx is to break down the fx you're going for into small manageable chunks and then slowly build it up using those building blocks. Breaking it down like that allows to tackle those smaller issues more easily, ask more specific questions about those small steps and then go from there. I find that with Houdini and its node-based system, things like that work really well, since it's so easy to just plug a few nodes together (either out-of-the-box ones or bits of nodes you found\/see online), try something, maybe branch off a thing here and there and then build up your effect quite organically from there\nI would also say to focus on the fx-side of things when learning Houdini...you won't do any modeling, texturing or animation yourself in fx. Some companies are lighting&amp;rendering in Houdini, but quite a few also render in some other software...\nThe Houdini community is also quite good - in my opinion - at sharing ideas and tips&amp;tricks on all but the most advanced topics (since those solutions are mostly kept in-house) so there's lots of knowledge to be found on the internet :slightly_smiling_face:",
