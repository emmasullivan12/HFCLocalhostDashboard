TV i would say, if you take the bigger vfx studios that are working on tv-series, they approach it more film-like nowadays - with longer turnarounds, more dev-time scheduled to develop those shots\/assets. Especially for big vfx TV shows (Game of Thrones and the like)\nCommercials is definitely on the other end of that spectrum...short\/quick turnarounds, no pixelfucking as they say :wink:, not a lot of time to really develop an effect - but also work on a handful of shots with quick edits and the whole thing is over in 30-60seconds anyway\nAs with everything this wildly differs, too, of course...some TV work is simpler (like some paint work to remove unwanted stuff in frame), but you also crazy good commercials that have a long turnaround time because of their complexity (like some of those longer commercials that run during the SuperBowl etc)",
