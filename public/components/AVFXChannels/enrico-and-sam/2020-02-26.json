But always interested in developing another style that could adapt a more simple stylised look. \n\nWith my portfolio, I’ve focused on developing work in my free time that focuses on 3d and 2d concept art. This is an area I would most like to pursue within the entertainment industry. I’m still developing my site layout, and considering more images that show my work process. Ive included a link below if you want to check it out...\n\n<http:\/\/www.samsaundersdesign.com|www.samsaundersdesign.com>\n\nI’m more than happy to get your feedback. If you see any noticeable gaps or things I should include that I haven’t already - Let me know. \n\nIve been considering the games industry as a possible move. But not ruling out industries like TV, film, commercials. \n\nSpeak soon. \n\nSam",
