Much appreciated. \n\nI’m currently working at an architectural company in central London as a visualisation artist in the Lighting team. And have been doing so for the last 7 years. I studied computer visualisation and animation at Ravenbourne and graduated in 2010. I’ve always been looking move into the entertainment industry ever since. \n\nThe team I currently work with need visualisation support for client presentations etc. But its always abit as and when. Ive been developing my portfolio over the last 4 years or so to focus more on concept art and attempting to expand into 3d more to avoid narrowing my job options. \n\nI noticed you’re an environment artist! Is that mainly 3d work or 2d? Most of my work focuses around environment design as its the area I enjoy developing the most. \n\nSam",

I’ve recently finished to work on a 2D tv serie at Blue Zoo in London as Environment Designer (basically I draw all the locations and some props). I mostly focus on 2D design but during the production of the show I was provided with 3D models from Sketchup to speedup the production. I’m also pushing my skills on ZBrush, so I can block basic shapes for my environment and have different angles for the same location. ",
