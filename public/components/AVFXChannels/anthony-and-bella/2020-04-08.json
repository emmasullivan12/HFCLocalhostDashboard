I recently graduated from the Academy of Art University where I got my Bachelor's in Animation &amp; Visual Effects with an emphasis on 3D Modeling. Ideally, would love to work for feature film animation or games, but I would love to have some input about how you became an art director, since I would like to eventually go down that path. Right now I'm doing some freelance jobs but if you also have any tips\/advice for me (artistically and also \"business\" wise) that would be great! I also stream on Twitch very often and I really enjoy it! I'm not sure if in my application you saw my portfolio, but if you haven't you can find it here <https:\/\/bellacgart.artstation.com\/> :smile:",
