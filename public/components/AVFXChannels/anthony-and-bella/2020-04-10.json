The Raven character has some good detail in it, and nice lighting. Well done.\n\nShowing off that same great work in the reel which is fantastic. I'm sure you have heard it before but, very important to only show the best work, or the type of work you want to be getting. It is a bit long though I would condense that into 40-50 sec tops.. People looking at reels all day dont have the time to sit through the whole thing and will move on after 20sec unless you grab their attention and always lead and end with your best work.",
