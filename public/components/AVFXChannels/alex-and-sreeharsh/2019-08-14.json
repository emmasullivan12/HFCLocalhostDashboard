The reason i wanted to try this was so I could make better and faster decisions on the fly under pressure and know what sorts of shapes are more likely to work. These are the first 9 so far of hopefully many more to come. I recorded the process of 005 if anyone wants to see how i go from Maya to Keyshot to Photoshop. <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/245141799>",
