Never ever I've seen a generalist modeling characters. As a generalist you get to shade them or texture or both, but not model. It's mostly in a very small boutiques where you have 20 people max and everyone is doing everything. Otherwise character modeler is a very competitive field and requires tremendous amount of knowledge in anatomy, topology and so forth.  While your cyborg looks cool you would need something organic(a lot of organic TBH :slightly_smiling_face: to get hired for character modeller. But I can clearly see that you are more passionate about characters so probably it's a good idea to go that route",
