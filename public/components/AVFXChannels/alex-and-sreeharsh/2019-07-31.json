        "text": "Hi Sreeharsh, nice to meet you!\nHere's a small introduction so you could understand my background better. I've been in VFX industry for over 7 years by now. Originally I'm Ukrainian and started my career in Kiev as a generalist. Quickly transitioned to modeling and then to lighting lookdev(because I'm not patient enough to model, I like to have immediate results :slightly_smiling_face: ) After a year in the best company in Kiev I moved to Prague,CZ because I was looking for a much higher level projects. To a certain extent I succeeded just because I could work on films like Warcraft and The Walk.\nSo after another year I moved to Warsaw, PL to Platige image. It was a lot of fun working there even though it was all about game cinematic. Also I became a lead lighter\/environments guy there. I brought  substance painter into pipeline and developed some pipeline tools as well as led development team for a few months. And before leaving platige I became a CG sup as well and after 2 and a half years in total I moved to London.\nHere I worked at MPC assets department(one of the best departments of MPC in my opinion) as a lead lookdev with majority of team in Bangalore,India, and after a year in MPC I moved to Framestore London.\nSo I'm here to answer all you VFX related questions.\nPersonally I really like playing games,watching films(lately almost exclusively in cinema), tv series(also only the best ones, I don't have time for anything worse than Breaking bad or Chernobyl) and I truly love Japanese art.\nI'm not sure about when and how often I'm gonna be available but we will figure this out along the way I guess. So feel free to write me any time but most likely I will be replying in bursts of long replies :slightly_smiling_face:",
