So be sure to use this last week to point them in the right direction and try to complete the Career Plan with them which will last long after the pilot finishes.\n\n:point_right:*Your challenge for this week* is to help your Mentee(s) complete the 3rd and final section of their Career Plan by Wed 19th July. Now that you've discovered a bit about them and they have seen what your working life is like, use the last section to lay out the road ahead and the steps they can start taking today to get them where they need to be! As before, you can use the question prompts we've listed to aid the discussion.\n\nDon't forget to provide them with a generous sprinkle of #employerskills - we've had great feedback from students saying that this really does help them understand how to display skills employers value.\n\nAnd of course we will be having our final leaderboards at the back end of next week :clapping:\n\nSo let's do this!\n:muscle::muscle::muscle:",
