It's a great way to tease out all the questions cooped up in their minds using the different headers &amp; question prompts. But also point them in the direction of the *tools and resources* we have hand picked for them and - of course - share your own favourite resources and links (TED talks, articles, inspiring stories\/quotes that have motivated you!). Part of being a mentor is guiding students to sources relevant to them amidst the sometimes overwhelming plethora of information out there!  \n\nSo get to it! :muscle::muscle::muscle:",
