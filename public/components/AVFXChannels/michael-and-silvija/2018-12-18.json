(Last time, I promise!)\nI am keep on trying to check, if there are no messages from you, but not getting any notifications, that is why in the end, I answer quite late :s \n\nThank You, I am great! \nI am working on little Jaspy, on Friday, I would be able to send you his brand new model, haha, if you would like me to.\n\nI am working on Friday, I am afraid, but, if you would like to, we could have a call during my lunch break, for 30 mins, or after 6.30pm or both times\n\nHow are you? How was your weekend?",
