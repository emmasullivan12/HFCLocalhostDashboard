It’s been intense, I worked all evenings very late but I sent it and let’s see what the company thinks.I would say that whenever I’m working on a intense TV serie, I’m usually tired in the evenings and I try to do something else, whether is just cooking, home stuff..I just need some time off from the screen. But it’s also necessary to try and so some personal work...when I’m on the job I gather information both from photos, so I make a research of references and also based on my personal life experience and what the storyboard for episode tells.",
