I guess before breaking the rules, warping, or flattening the image in a unrealistic way work well for children’s book but not often for cinematic, or at least not in a extreme way, and as my Art Director said once, before breaking the rules you have to know them! :) So of course for him perspective is very important especially on Backgrounds or production work. So after you try more ‘realistic’ and ‘correct’ images then will be natural and more efficient trying to simplify and starting to distort your shape and perspective. Eventually at this stage you could find ways that could build up your ‘style’. Another artist that work between Children’s book and Films is Pascal Campion. Also Goro Fujita. Check out also Annette Marnat and Amélie Fléchais.\n\nYes, for my children’s book I decided to keep perspective and cinematic images but I’d like to try more ‘illustrative’ and flat once.",
