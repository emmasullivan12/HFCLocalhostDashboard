I do feel I work in a way that stems closer to editorial illustration\/children's' book Illustration, It might be good for me to find more artists that have come from a illustrative starting point and to listen to how their journey might have been like when working in animation. I wonder if then, in the case of these sorts of artists- if they work more freelance and are hired to work on particular projects based on their specialised visual approaches?",

Usually artists that work for animation companies are mostly versatile with their style, cause they need to change and adapt to a lotof different projects they are commissioned. Those artists are working mostly freelancing cause they have experience and clients but I’m sure they have also in-house experiences! Let’s say that they have been able to develop a personal style that is recognizable, and can work for both tv and children’s books! Sometimes studios do hire an artist for his\/her unique approach or style.",
