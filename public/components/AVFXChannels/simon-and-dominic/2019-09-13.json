In particular, how I would present myself, for example showreel, CV, website. \nThis should start a chain reaction where I can start to put the building blocks into place to work towards gaining an internship and finally moving into the industry post-university. \n\n2. I also wanted to seek pathways into freelancing. \n\n3. For The Mill in particular I would like to find out about making applications\/best approach\/how to stand out - I did take a really big interest in The Mill from a young age, I love the atmosphere and the way they present themselves. \n\nWhat do you think??\n",
