(But I’m sure they have already showed you this). It’s also a great opportunity to learn thing for colleagues you work with and to get some new pieces for your showreel. They usually invite guest speakers once a week and I can recommend to go and listen to them if you have the opportunity.\n\nAnd don’t forget to enjoy the monthly beer and pizza Fridays! :wink:\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions or things you wonder about and I  will try to answer as best as I can.",
