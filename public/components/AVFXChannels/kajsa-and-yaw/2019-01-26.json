I must have completely overlooked your last message, I only just saw it.\n\nNo worries if it take some time to do the Showreel fixes. Better to take the time and make it good. And when you have a new version I be happy to have a look at it.\n\nAs for your question about what I enjoy most about working in the VFX industry, I think it’s great to work in a big team with professional artist and share ideas. To work on shots and use creative problem solving, trying to find the best and fastest way to get the result the supervisor wants.\nAnd it’s quite an amazing feeling to go to the cinema and see the result of all the hard work we put in, on the big screen. :wink:",
