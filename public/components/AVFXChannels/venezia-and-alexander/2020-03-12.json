Weâ€™ve recently launched our firstmeans on Snapchat ðŸ¥³ Itâ€™s a cool cooking game called Ready Chef Go.\n\nOther than that, I went to the University of Southampton and graduated with First Class Honours in Games Design and Art. \n\nIn addition to being a designer at Mojiworks, I also work on a few side projects where I make 3D environments. \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps you and Iâ€™d love to hear a bit more about you too.
