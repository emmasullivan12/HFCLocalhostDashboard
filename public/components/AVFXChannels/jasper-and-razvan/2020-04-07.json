I finished last summer university on 3D design and animation. I was my first contact with this industry prior to applying for it. During my time there I've come to the conclusion that I would like to be an FX artist. Unfortunately there was no course which in clouded Houdini, so I've tried to piece together bits and pieces I've found around the Internet in order to learn it. Turns out it's quite complex but I do enjoy it. My main issues is not exactly finding tutorials but having a structured plan in lerning the software, as some of them go by with the assumption of having some specific knowledge. I hope I didn't ramble on too much and this could show a general idea of a starting point.",
