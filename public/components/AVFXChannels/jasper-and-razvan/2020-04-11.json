And relates to something I wanted to ask you, where did you start with Houdini, learning wise? I've been looking on that link you sent me and other things I could find. A good part of what I find is out of date and non applicable to newer versions. With others I'm jsut confused as to what use they might have. This leads to another question. Considering that I am a beginner, should I jsut learn anythign I find and later focus on things directed towards FX? That's the main brach I want to focus on.",
