When I first started learning Houdini at university, our course didn't offer support for it so I was just using any online resource I could find but the thing that helps the most is when you have a goal\/effect in mind that you want to achieve. For example instead of looking up how to create fire in houdini, you would give yourself a goal of creating a wooden stick torch and have the fire follow that around a scene. In the process of searching up how to do that, you would learn more about pyro than you would if you followed just one tutorial.",
