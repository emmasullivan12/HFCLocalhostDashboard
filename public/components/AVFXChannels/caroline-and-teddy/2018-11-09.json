I think it would be helpful if you could have a think over the next week about the hard skills you're learning on the course, like life drawing, rigging, sculpting (for example) and give them two scores from 1-5 - first for how well you're doing, like the grades you're getting and one for how much you enjoy it\/how easy you find it to put in the hours. Often when you loose track of time when you're doing something tells you how much you enjoy doing it. And then think of a list of soft skills, like listening, cooperating with others, giving feedback, and give yourself a score from 1-5 of how good you are. I can try to find a list of the soft skills which might help you.",
