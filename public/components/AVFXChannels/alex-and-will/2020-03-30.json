I don't think your lighting is that bad but it's just over exposed. Now if you want to make it one to one to plate you need to make it darker and remove all directional looking lights. Though I wouldn't go that far. You can leave one or two supportive lights but not more. Try to play with 2 sources, hdri and area, and only when you're happy at third one",
