You've packed a lot in that show reel in little time, I wouldn't be afraid to cut a few things!\nI've broken down a few things that stand out :)\n00:00 - 00:03 Love the intro! Sometimes only a few brush strokes can convey movement effectively, beautiful. Only thing is that it speeds up at the end and your character zaps out, tiny detail though.\n00:08 - 00:03 Incorporating the reference you have in that clip we've just seen can help make them feel more integrated. A suggestion could be to freeze it at 00:11, break down the three layers and then resume the animation.\n00:24 - Nice studies there! The animation is so beautiful I reckon you can have the walk cycle take up the whole screen and then have the concepts\/tests come afterwards.. It'd be such a shame to minimise that clip, it's really pretty!\n00:33 - Good portraits, although I wonder if the last one at 00:34 is strong enough to stand alone. Looking at your online portfolio, I reckon the four at the top stand out the most.\n00:35 - 00:44 Really nice light and mood study. A suggestion is to have the reference as a little icon overlaid on top of your breakdown to separate it from the rest.\n00:54 love the animation, the movements are really fluid!\n01:02 The Maya part at the end is a little confusing, maybe a little explanation can help.\nFeel free to ignore any feedback you don't agree with :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:",
