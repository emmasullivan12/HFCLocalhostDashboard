But a lot of the time I'll meet studios (now remotely) and demonstrate the products. In my previous job though I'd worked on a few environments on the 3d version of Asterix, but the majority of the time I was debugging the scenes and set dressing for the Asterix and Shelock Gnomes projects. The last reel I had was when I graduated, I don't practise what I preach by keeping my showreel updated! Although now I mainly do studio meetings, webinars or roadshow presentations, not really something you can put in a showreel :P",
