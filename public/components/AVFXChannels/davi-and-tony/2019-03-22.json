Though I unfortunately don’t know the Korean market. \nI wasn’t sure if you were Korean when Dexter refereed you to me. \nMay I ask why you want to move to Korea? \n\nThese is probably more vfx work in London :wink: and you would get great experience and advance your skills faster here on more high end projects (commercials, films, and\/or episodic tv series ). Then move to Korea with already more experience in the industry. \n\nAlso do you need a work permit for Korea? \n",
