I am trying to get some more work completed so I can begin preparing a showreel. I contacted every single company in Korea asking them whether i need to speak Korean or not and nobody got back to me yet, I plan on taking Korean lessons as well after graduating.\nHow should i approach Korean companies and how much work should I have ?",
