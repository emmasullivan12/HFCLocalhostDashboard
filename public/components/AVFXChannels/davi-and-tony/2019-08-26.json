Happy to give any feedback on stuff :blush: \nAlso if you need help on Cv’s, cover letter, etc for applying to creative, games, or vfx companies, I’d be happy to give tips. \nMy graduated students have been busy this summer in vfx jobs. Really proud of them :blush: \nIt’s busy I’m the London market nowadays so that’s a good sign. And quite a few vfx companies are also doing VR\/games. Pretty neat stuff. ",
