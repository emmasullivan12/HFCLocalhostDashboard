I think if we set one for each subject, that could be good? They need to be realistic and achievable. For example , getting one piece of coursework up one grade, or starting reading into a specific area of architecture, etc etc. Let me know your thoughts and we can set these. They don't have to be by the end of the year but could be.\n\nYour personal statement is a great place to start. How about writing at least a paragraph a week before the end of the year? I can look over it whenever you like. \n\nRegarding work experience, it's totally up to you but I can't stress enough how good it is to have work experience as well as academic stuff. It really helped me with my uni applications. If you are interested, I can definitely ask something and sons, if you like the look of them? \n\nHope you've had a good Monday!! \n\n",
