So, when I chose my A Level options I did whatever I was confident with. But I couldn’t choose Art and Geography because they were in the same category, so I sacrificed art because geography would “open more doors” for me. \nLong story short: I started with 3 A Levels but half way during year 12 I picked up Art again because I decided I did want to get into architecture but needed subjects relevant to the course :white_frowning_face: \n\nI shall look at Goldsmith. I chose my uni options according to the proximity from my home, so I’ll see if it is suitable for me :slightly_smiling_face:\n",
