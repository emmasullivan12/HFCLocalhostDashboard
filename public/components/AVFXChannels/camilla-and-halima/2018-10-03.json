Also philosophy was the only subject I got an AS grade in so practically if I do drop it my one year worth of education doesn’t entirely go to waste because I got UCAS points for it. ",

I really want to do geography AND art as they’re both relevant to architecture. Philosophy isn’t as useful to me anymore and it’s actually quite challenging to understand. ",
