The first one was really bad because my portfolio was really weak compared to other candidates, and it was at my 1\/2nd choice university:( HOWEVER,  I did get an offer so that's great! The interview for Kingston was good, as it was only 1 day apart from my Westminster one - I got an unconditional offer :smile: but only if I make that my first choice. After visiting Greenwich, Westminster and Kingston I'm struggling to decide which one I like better.. They all have their advantages and disadvantages",
