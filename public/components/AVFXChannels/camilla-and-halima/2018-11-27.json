I remember this really well at A-Level (I got some 'questionable' grades, to say the least). It's really important to remember that at the moment, you're doing coursework or mock exams\/essays. You've definitely got enough time to make sure you get those grades up, and you don't have to panic. You only started in September, it's barely any time! The pre-xmas term is always the hardest.  I also think the jump from GCSE to A-Level is the biggest jump you'll ever see. I really found this.",
