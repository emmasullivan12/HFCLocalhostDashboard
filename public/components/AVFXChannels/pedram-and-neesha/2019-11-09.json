I have been busy in replying...I was part of a short film last weekend as Script Supervisor which I thoroughly enjoyed. I like being part of a creative team making a film. I have applied for a work experience vfx at the Brewery VFX, to reconnect after a break in my situation. Have you heard of them? ",
