I am fine, at home but have been accepted on the Return To Work scheme and will have the first meeting soon, however placements arenâ€™t guaranteed. \nYou have been a great support during throughout so I wish you well and hope things get back to normal. I am not sure how long this Mentor chat is for but if I can still chat not as a Mentee now and again, that would be nice. If things are too bad and difficult to find work after I might just drop the whole idea of returning to VFX and try to work as a full time artist instead which is what I am doing at home too. \nHope you are good. \n\nNeesha ",
