This book sound like a good modern read which I needed other than Twitter and VFX groups for articles. Part\/time\/job sharing is getting popular not yet but I will be trying to chase people up. If you know of any roto\/prep artists looking for a job share then do let them know. I think to return I would need to start as prep artist to the compositor. I am really out of practise and donâ€™t have Nuke software either, is there anyone who I can shadow for a couple of hours Mon\/Tuesdays? I have been talking to a VFX Producer about shadowing too. \nThanks anyway. Hope you have a great Christmas and New Year. ",
