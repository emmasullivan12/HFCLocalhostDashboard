It looks like I will still be working at home for Framestore but waiting on remote logins and stuff for now so just taking the time to relax really. Yeah i think this chat stays open, not sure but yeah would definitely be good to stay in touch. Really happy to hear you've been accepted onto the scheme! Hopefully all goes well and you find a placement soon. Keep me updated with how that goes, fingers crossed.",
