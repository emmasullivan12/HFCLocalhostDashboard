Love all the different styles, are they all separate stories or are you using cultural myths as a basis? Which one are you working on?\nAnd cool about your short film! How did that come about? I mean about having a need to tell a story about arts and sciences?\nAnd I haven't met Rhea yet, there is definitely a lot of artists here, which is a blessing and curse, especially for meeting everyone :smiley:",
