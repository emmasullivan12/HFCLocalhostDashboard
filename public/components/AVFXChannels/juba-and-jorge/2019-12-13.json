One of my friends told me that maybe the way to go would be focusing on Storyboarding and Directing. Start maybe at an animation studio in Vancouver or London (if possible).",

So I 100% understand you! :smiley:\nStoryboard and layout would give you a lot of tools for your own stories for sure. If you'd like I know some people in the layout\/ storyboarding industry I can reach out to and they might be able to give you some specific tips! I'll still be happy to help in anyway I can =D",
