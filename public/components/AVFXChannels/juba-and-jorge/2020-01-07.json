I've sent messages around just waiting for replies about the layout\/storyboarding.\nI have a few ideas, just short films for now and a couple of written scripts for those. I think the closest to being made is a sequel to a short film I made back in school! There was a lot I wanted to do that I didn't have the experience for so I think I can explore the whole concept better. How about yourself?",
