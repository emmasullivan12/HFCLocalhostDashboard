I know I changed my mind numerous times and still didn't become a Journalist :grinning:... which is what I thought I would be. A lot of people I work with have a couple of different roles at once or have retrained throughout the years to do different jobs. My advice would be to look at what you enjoy doing inside and outside of studies. I can see you have an interest in Science there. Maths and Science are great subjects for VFX and CGI roles such as; <https:\/\/www.accessvfx.org\/careers>  But sometimes its easier to strip things back to what do you enjoy?",
