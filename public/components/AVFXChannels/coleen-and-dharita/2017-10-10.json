I'm delighted to hear about your interest in a career in architecture and hope I'll be able to answer any questions you might have. Typically I'll be able to reply during my lunch break and at evenings and weekends. During the working day I can be quite busy but I'll always get back to you as soon as I can. \n\nLooking forward to mentoring you!",
