I saw lots of people and I am rubbish with names.\n\nThe only thing I can suggest about your showreel it is just a bit unclear what you are applying for. If you are going for an animation internship I'm not too sure you need to include all the matte painting etc. Try and focus\/tailor it to what you want to work with. It's nice to include some different bits to show your creativitiy, but it is just unclear right now. It is ok to have multiple showreels, one for concept art and one for animation etc. Unless you are going for a generalist role but then I would suggest that you need other things too.\n\nIf you get your animations up on syncsketch I can give those a once over in more detail if you would like.\n\nKeep going, you're doing great!",
