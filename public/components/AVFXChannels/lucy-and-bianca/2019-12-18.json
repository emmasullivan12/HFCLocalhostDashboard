Nuke is very widely used in the industry and is used to produce almost all of the films you see, including many past Oscar winners for best VFX. At the beginning of this year I fancied a change and moved to DNEG, one of the largest VFX houses in London, to see what it was like being closer to production. I’m now leading a team responsible for DNEG‘S in-house fur software. This has also been used on many films, recently including Avengers Endgame and the upcoming Disney+ film Togo. ",
