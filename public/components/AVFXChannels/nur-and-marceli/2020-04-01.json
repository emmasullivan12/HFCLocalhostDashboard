Whenever you have time.\n\nFor the mask topology, that’s aim is to see your alternative approaches on facial topology\/not only making a lower poly mesh but some alternative routes for loops-think like a puzzle. I don’t expect you to ‘remodel’ that, just to draw on your render another topology you may suggest. \nNot using disp map on model is ok-but in this case you can look for other loop routes during you modelling, not to make the topology denser or unfunctional. Think about “what else I can do for those loops”. This is like a game and I find very inspiring. If there is no way to stay away from that, then it is ok. \n\nFor Harbinger, except it has 6 arms and face, the body looks liek a huge human in the concept too(backside muscles are exactly like human also). So you may consider that like a human. As I said, the concept designer also made those deltoidish part like membrane; a tiny skin from chest to biceps, but not a muscle. At least you may consider this alternative. Or if you like it to stay like your version, please do as you wish. This is your model and you are free to what to do. My suggestion is another eye from outside. \n\nPlease send your presentation when you are ready and also let me know if you have some modeling concerns on your future or previous projects.\n\nI wish you good luck with your busy schedule and to have a lovely day!\n",
