I'm mostly drawn to character art that's more on the realistic side, but I'm definitely interested in stylized stuff too, and I know that it's all transferable skills. I could send you the stuff I've been working on for my showreel so far and see what you think? I'd also be really interested to hear what it's like being a freelancer, as that really doesnt get covered by my course, but I realise that there is a big demand for freelancers across animation and VFX especially. \n\nFor sharing work, should I send stuff here? Or would you rather communicate by email? :)",
