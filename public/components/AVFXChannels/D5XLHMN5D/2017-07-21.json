        "text": "Hey <@U4V22C6A1> ! \n\nIt really depends on if you are filling a contract or permanent role. A contract role you would expect to find a candidate that week. For perm placements I would expect the role to be filled within 2-4 weeks. If you are doing 'executive search' where it is more headhunting, then it can take a matter of months, but this is dealing with £70k+ salaries with 'c-suite' candidates. Those recruiters typically only make a placement probably every 1.5 months. The salaries I deal with are £20-30k and I generally look to make a placement every 1-2 weeks. \n\nWe have a girl in our office who does commercial roles, like admin and call centre staff etc and she can make deals in one week as the interview process is shorter and they don't look for such high calibre candidates so the process finding a candidate is much shorter. \n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you need any more info :) happy to help!!",

However the industry standard is actually 20% for perm placements. This obviously gets negotiated quite a bit when winning new clients, the lowest I have ever done is 12.5% and that was only because it was in Southampton and I don't recruit that area. It can go up to even 30% if the role is very difficult to fill, I know someone at one of my clients placed a project manager at an oil rig in Libya and it was like a 27% fee, and they made a serious amount on that deal. \n\nYes it is typically the same for contract\/temp placements, however it can get a bit confusing as it's all to do with day rates, and how much you decide to pay the temp (the client pays you all their salary, you pay the contractor the agreed rate and keep the rest, which is your gross profit)\n\nI don't know masses and masses about contract as I've never worked in contract recruitment but it's my market so I try and learn as much as I can. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions :) ",
