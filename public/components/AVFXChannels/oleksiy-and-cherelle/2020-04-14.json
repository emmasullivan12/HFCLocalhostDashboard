I like the the detail of him tapping the door to look for the handle and the poses in general.\nAs for feedback, the moment in which he slinks through the door after opening it feels odd, as it happens twice and kind of breaks his neck. Maybe you could make him curl inwards in a mischievous way just to give more character.\nWhen he's searching for the handle it would help to have him look around more with his head, right now he's pretty still as if focusing on something past the camera and not giving the impression of being cautious of everything.\nAlso it would be nice to see him peeking through the gap immediately after slipping through the door, just to sell that character even more.",
