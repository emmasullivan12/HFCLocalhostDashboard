As> far as variety goes you've got a good selection of different elements like lip sync, body mechanics etc. From the selection I get the impression that you want to focus on character focused and stylized animation, the kind you'd find in TV productions, commercials or potentially feature animations. If that's your aim then you're heading in the right direction.\nAs far as the editing goes it seems a bit sporadic, particularly seeing the lip sync bits being broken up. While it may feel more consistent throughout, it would be nice to see the finished pieces as a whole, or at least glued together so its more coherent, or if you feel like you can trim off some bits you're not happy with that's fine too.\nNow before I get into specific animation feedback or direction I'd like to ask, what particular element do you feel is the weakest and\/or that you'd like to develop more for the position you're looking for? That'll give us a more specific goal to aim for instead of a blanket critique.",
