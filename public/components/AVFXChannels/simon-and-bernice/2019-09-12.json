Some goals I have in mind is just pretty much figuring out where to get a start into doing illustration and animation (2D as a start). I want to learn more about the industry and what it has to offer. So would like to have some ground knowledge and work up from there.\n\nI don’t know if you are aware but I don’t really have a background in this area. In terms of educational or professional background, but, I am really motivated in channeling my interest in the industry to a career. Just would like some guidance and advice on how to get started. \n\n\nI haven’t got much of a background \n\nactually have no background in animation or illustration so I do feel kind of out of place. But I aspire to become an animator\/illustrator just thought this would be a good place for me to start.",
