I had never thought of having a gap year to see how self learning would turn out and having university the next year to fall back on if I felt like it wasn't working out. Now that you mention it, it seems like an excellent option. Regarding the portfolio, you're absolutely right the format isn't doing the work any justice and I'll definitely be looking to set it up to a decent standard once I've figured out a better way to showcase the work as well.",
