If you decide to go for that option, you can even have a chat with your preferred university about the matter, and ask them if they can save you a place for what would be 2021 :slightly_smiling_face: That way you won't have to go through the whole application process again :smile: But yeah, feel free to let me know when you have other stuff to review or if you need help with anything you are working on at the minute. Very happy to go through any CVs and such as well!",
