So its all about finding balance and scheduling. \n\nThe show looks visually stunning. Some very beautiful comp work and colour storys, must give it a watch when I get the chance. \n\nIve got some exciting updates. So after my freelance period in Lexhag I have been contacted with a suggestion for a job offer in may time when I graduate in production as a coordinator!! \n\nThey said that they were very impressed and that It seemed like I was there for a long time prior and sloted right into the team! \n\nGreat to have options open. I feel very chuffed, nice to know that hard work is recognised! \n\nI'm also going to FMX this march booked my flights today. So all very busy but very exciting! \n\nWhat was your forst industry job? \nHope you are well!",
