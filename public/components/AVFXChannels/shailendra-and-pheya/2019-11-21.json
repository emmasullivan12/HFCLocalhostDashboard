However you might find other similar tools at other places\n\n-Interesting\nVisual art is often used to showcase fashion.\nLook forward to seeing what you come up with\n\n-Tips for production role\nIâ€™d say reach out proactively to recruiters. meet in person when possible and show your interest in what you do while you are still at university. see if you can organize a class visit to some of the places you wish to work at(many of them will do it when they are not super busy)\n\nin an interview talk about all the projects you have worked at, challenges, what did you learn especially the ones in a team.\n\nif you have done something cool, talk about your role confidently(folks in the industry can see it without hard evidence, they are judging from experience and can see potential)\n\nto add to this one of my co-ordinators graduated with a nice compositing reel and transitioned to a production role based on her interest. she is really good and gets us what artists need well before we even ask for it because of her background.\n\n\n",
