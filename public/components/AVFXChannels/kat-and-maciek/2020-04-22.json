I think a lot of people, especially those newer to the industry, feel like they need to stay late to prove themselves, but all it ends up doing is burning them out. I feel quite strongly about it actually, because when people stay late, it also messes up with production deadlines and can make others feel like they have to do the same thing. So leaving on time and having a life outside of work is essential in my opinion!",

Since then I've worked all over the place here in London! My latest was at Studio AKA on a 30 minute film that just released on AppleTV, and I did a short stint at DNEG Features and now I'm here at Jellyfish working on their upcoming feature film ^^",
