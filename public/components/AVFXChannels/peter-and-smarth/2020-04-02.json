Do you watch the TV show Dragon's Den? That gives a good insight into getting investment, or at least the info investors need.\n\nWe tend to advertise on social media mainly, but much of work comes from referrals and word of mouth. That would be different for each type of creative industry.\n\nWe are based in Cardiff but work with clients around the UK and overseas. We have a studio, although currently we are all working remotely.\n\nThanks\n\nPete",
