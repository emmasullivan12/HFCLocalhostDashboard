Back on Monday 20th April though.\n\nRight, let's dive into these questions then.  Yes, I love writing, it's the thing that makes me happiest regardless of the money, or lack of it.\n\nThe short film was for a scheme called It's my Shout, each year they look for directors, writers, crew and actors with limited experience to take part. My script was picked out of the submissions.\nI had to do some rewriting based on notes from the producer and director, but then left them to make the film. Again, no pay, but valuable experience. I studied screenwriting after I did my degree but drifted into comics. Now that I have 10 years tv\/film experience I am starting to use my contacts to get back into writing for the screen.\n\nI set up a small virtual studio called Orang Utan Comics - basically a website and then spoke to artists and persuaded them to draw my comics, then sold them at conventions, online and in my local comic shop. So a small business that didn't make money, but covered all its costs.\n\nShall we move into some specific start your own business questions next? I have run two virtual studios, been MD at a radio station and a vfx studio so despite not setting up my own company, have set up new ventures and run businesses for others.\n\nThanks\nPete",
