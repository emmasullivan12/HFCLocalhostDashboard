How  did you turn the story into a movie? If you don’t mind me asking how much did get paid for writing the story? Did you think of making a movie or it just happened because you had friends who helped you to air it on bbc??\nWhere were you selling your books? And why on that platform?\nWhat do you mean by ‘ I published myself ‘ ???\nI really want to start a business but I don’t know how to, any advices??\n\nThanks\nSmarth",
