I then did a Business Education degree as at one point I planned to teach Business Studies, or at least have that as something to fall back on if my creative endeavours didn't succeed.\n\nI didn't found the business I run, I was brought in 8 years ago to help run it, as two companies had merged. Last January I became the Managing Director. I spent 10 years working in radio, ended up  as a radio station MD before moving to VFX\/Motion Design\/Animation 10 years ago, so I've spent half my career in each industry.\n\nWhat that has given me is an insight into clients, running a business and managing a team. The profit or passion question is an interesting one, I think the two can go hand in hand. I always say if you chase the money you will usually not make much as your decisions will be short term and purely motivated by revenue. However if you are passionate about what you do, that passion will create create work which you can charge more for, ultimately giving you more profit than if you just went after the ££.\n\nThanks\n\nPete",
