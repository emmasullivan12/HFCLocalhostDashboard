I have also written a short film that aired on the BBC.\n\nThe Interactives from Markosia is one book, The Intergalactic Adventures of Zakk Ridley for Markosia is another.\n\nI have been writing in some way since I was first able to hold a pen. Writing short stories and plays in school and then writing comics later.\n\nMy first comic I published myself in the mid 2000s, it was nominated for best British black and white comic at the Eagle awards. That helped me get writing work with other publishers.\n\nFrom notes to a physical book meant learning a lot about plotting and writing, but also about working with an artist and publishing and marketing as I did it all myself.\n\nSadly comics doesn't have much money in it, so I haven't made any real money from it. Most are paid back end (that means a share of profits) which often dont' come!\n\nHope this helps\n\nThanks",
