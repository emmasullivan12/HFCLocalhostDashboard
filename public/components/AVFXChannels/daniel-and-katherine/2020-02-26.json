The key benefit of using an auto-rigger is how easily it allows you to re-use the same joint hierarchy, so you could run through the process with different characters, and have the same animations run on them either in engine or when referenced into a scene in maya, as the hierarchy will be the same.\n\nI guess speaking broadly I would say no, you're not likely to use blendshapes on mobs\/npcs.  Blendshapes tend to be for the hero character, as blendshapes are just a little bit more expensive runtime wise, but also a blendshape has to be custom made, where a joint can be applied to any mesh. I can expand on that if you like, but the crux of it is that blendshapes are bespoke where as joints are one size fits all.",
