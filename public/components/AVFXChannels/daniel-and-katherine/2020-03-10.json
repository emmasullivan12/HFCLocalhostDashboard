Sorry it's been awhile I had an essay that was due:weary:. \n\nGoing off what you said about the joint heirarchy needing to be the same, what do you do then if you need to add extra joints for things like different clothes or extra accessories characters might have or would you not add joints for that?\n\nAn example I had was for one projects I had 2 witch characters with the same joint setup but one had a cape and the other had long baggy sleeves which the animators wanted to be able to move and rotate, so it sways when they move. Overall their joint heirarchys where the same but does adding those extra joints then mean things can't be reused on both of them, like animation since their heirarchies would be slightly different but have the same core body joint setup?",
