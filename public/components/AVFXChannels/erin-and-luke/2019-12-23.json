In an effort to create my thesis project, I was looking for someone familiar with the F.X. industry and knowledgable with the Houdini program, who would be willing to offer suggestions and guidance. The mentors\/committee members do not have to be physically present but make themselves readily available to provide feedback and review elements. The timetable of the project requires close collaboration between the student, mentors, and committee members. The commitment to the project entails receiving, reviewing, and offering suggestions to Houdini .HIP files, written text, and visual renders\/simulations, under very short turn around times (24 hours or less).\n\nI understand that this is and can be very time-consuming. If this commitment appears that it would interfere with your work\/schedule, please let me know, and I will reach out to someone else.\n\nSincerely,\nLuke Vuilliomenet",
