I wanted to send a quick greeting and introduce myself after receiving your profile.\n\nAs mentioned before, my name is Luke Vuilliomenet, and I am a first-year M.F.A. Visual Effects Student at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). I specialize in Houdini FX, technical direction, and C.G. Lighting, intending to join a studio after my graduation to work in advertisement and possibly feature film.\n\nAn essential part of receiving my degree is a thesis presented at the end of the course. Part of this thesis is a committee of three people, chosen from within the school, and intended industry with approval. The three individuals act as guides\/mentors and evaluators of the project.\n\nI would ask if you would be willing to work with me in the creation of my thesis, followed by joining the committee when formed in roughly a year?\n\nI greatly appreciate you taking the time to consider mentoring my thesis work and look forward to working with you.",
