Sorry for the late reply, had a pretty busy day :see_no_evil: I'm not sure if you've been told anything about me yet so I'll just give you a bit of background information about me. At school my favourite subject was probably Chemistry and I enjoyed learning topics covered in science and maths. At A levels I studied Chemistry, Biology and Physical Education. And currently I am Physiotherapy student in my final year at University.",
