Well I wouldn't say it was many people's favourite subject :joy: there were a few reasons I decided: I had a careers test which gives you some results on what type of work you are good at (e.g. Reasoning etc) and it came up on that and my dad had already suggested it as a potential career so I went to shadow some physiotherapists to see what it was like and really liked it! I also didn't want a job that was predominantly sitting at a computer cause I'm quite an active person :relaxed: ahh nice! Which is your favourite out of those? And have you had a look at what you may want to do when you finish school? ",
