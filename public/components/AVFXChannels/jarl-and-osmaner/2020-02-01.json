I'm also not sure what info you've already heard about me, so apologies in advance if I'm repeating things you've already been told.\n\nI'm an animator currently working at MPC in London. My professional background is actually also in rigging, but I've always been most passionate about animation, and relatively recently switched into animation approximately two years ago. \n\nI'm originally from the USA, and came over to the UK in 2010 to work at Framestore as a rigger on the movie Gravity. I continued as a rigger at Framestore for many years, getting the opportunity to work on a number of other exciting projects like Iron Man 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, Paddington, and Fantastic Beasts.\n\nWhen I switched over to being an animator two years ago, I changed employers as well, working at a few medium-sized studios at first, and finally starting my current job at MPC about a year ago.\n\nI understand you enjoy working in Houdini, and that you are currently working on your showreel with the hopes of landing a job as an FX artist? That's cool to hear! I'd like to hear more about what you enjoy with FX and what you're currently working on. I probably cannot offer super specific advice about FX, but I do have roughly 10 years experience working in VFX, both in technical and creative positions, so it is my hope that I can still give you some useful advice\/feedback\/ideas to help you with your goals as an artist.\n\nLooking forward to getting this mentorship going!\n\nJarl",
