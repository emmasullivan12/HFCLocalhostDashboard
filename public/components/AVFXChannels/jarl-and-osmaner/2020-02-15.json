My apologies. \n\nSounds like a great adventure you had so far, really inspiring. I love Houdini due to it’s proceduralism &amp; technical problem solving end and obviously I find it really inspiring that there is no limit to what we can achieve. I really enjoy all aspects of Houdini but mainly been working on fluids, volumes and rigids. At the moment I’ve been working on a custom tool that generates ripples without using flip simulation, so it’s all geometry based. Also I’ve been working on pyro simulations for other final year films as freelancer. I’ll also have a some extra time in 2 weeks to do some personal projects, I’m just not too sure what kind of extra work would get me hired at this point. \n\nIt’s nice to hear you were working at Framestore, this week on Monday I managed to take my first step in as training specialist at Framestore to cover someone’s sickness for 2 weeks. And going to continue working there as a casual runner while finishing my studies. \n\nHere is my showreel as well if you’d like to take a look, it’d be absolutely amazing to get your crit if possible :) <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/384566579>\n\nI’m really excited to have as my mentor, I’m looking forward hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nOsmaner.",
