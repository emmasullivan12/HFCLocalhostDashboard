I've been temporarily transferred over to the Tracking department to help them out as they suddenly have a lot of work to do...!\nI have never done Tracking before so I have had to get stuck in learning the theory and software - I've been doing a lot of pestering of the Tracking team to figure it all out and luckily they are a really friendly, helpful and patient bunch of people so it has been going smoothly so far!\nIt's a bonus of working at Framestore that if work dries up, they will still try to keep you on board as much as they can and this might mean you get shuffled around the departments a little bit. Tracking is something I never thought I would ever really get involved in, but being transferred onto the team has pushed me out of my comfort zone and now I can add a new skill to my belt and increase my employability within the industry. :raised_hands:",
