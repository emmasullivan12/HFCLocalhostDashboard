Also, my schedule has changed and I think Tuesdays I wont be available for our chat, so please remind me what other days of the week and times are good for you.\nWe are going to be working on a new environment, this time with characters in it! We are going to start learning Unreal. Right now we are working on researching, backstory and initial concepts, probably by next week I'll have good enough material to show you :blush:",
