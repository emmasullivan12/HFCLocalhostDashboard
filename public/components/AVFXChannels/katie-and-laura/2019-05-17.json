Regular meet-ups and outreach events will be held all in the spirit of ACCESS: VFX’s core mission of actively pursuing and encouraging inclusion, diversity and opportunity across our incredible visual effects, animation and games industries.\n\nToday is our launch day, and we’re excited to get the word out, but the official Q-VFX kickoff event is planned for June so look out for more details to follow. Q-VFX will be run by a diverse group of people from different companies, positions and backgrounds and is designed to be fully inclusive of everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community. We cannot wait to share more with you!\n\nIf this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, please sign up to our mailing list at <http:\/\/www.accessvfx.org\/qvfx|www.accessvfx.org\/qvfx> and let us know.\nTo find out more you can listen to our launch podcast here and join our Facebook group.\n\nThanks!\nThe Q-VFX team\"_",
