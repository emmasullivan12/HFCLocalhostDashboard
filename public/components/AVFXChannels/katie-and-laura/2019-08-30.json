So sorry I did't stay much in touch lately.. went through a few rough weeks in terms of health so had to get away from screens as much as possible, specially since I was on break. I am a lot better now and getting back on track where I left off. Classes start soon so I am coming in to uni to start working on a few ideas for personal side projects. Thank you so much for your time and support, I will definitely send Elliot an email soon, and continue looking for more networking opportunities. Now that I am starting my second year I feel a bit more confident to look for an internship opportunity. Hope you've also enjoyed the summer and you've had some time to chill. My best wishes to you too:sunny::herb:",
