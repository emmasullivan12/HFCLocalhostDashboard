Through this program, I am hoping to gain more advice on what I should be doing to increase my chances of securing a place in the biomedicine sector, for example, how and where I could look for a laboratory-based work experience. It's great to hear that you are about to start your year long placement, I always find that a year in the industry is very exciting! I was wondering if you could tell me more about  how you came to study Chemical engineering, where you are studying it and what is it like? Thank you and I apologize again for the late reply.",
