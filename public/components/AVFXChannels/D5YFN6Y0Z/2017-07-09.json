I think from my experience applying to Uni, it was more important that I demonstrated having key skills through the work experience and job that I did. I wouldn't say I had any experience relevant to Chemical Engineering! Have you ever done any work experience or had a job before? With regards to getting work experience in a lab I would advise searching for labs in your area and either emailing or calling them and asking if they can offer you anything. I came to study my degree through going to a lot of Uni open days and looking at different course options. I considered maths, natural sciences and finance but realised that chemical engineering was a good combination of the sciences I enjoyed, maths and problem solving. It's an enjoyable but challenging course and there are so many different industries it is involved in which really appeals to me. I hope that helps! ",
