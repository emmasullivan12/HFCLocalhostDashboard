        "text": "Hi Alex! Firstly, apologies for the ridiculously late reply there had been some technical issues with the school email and I was unable to get it fixed over the summer. Over the summer holidays, I attended about four different summer schools and gained lab experience from that. I also arranged a week of work experience at my local hospital in the Radiology department which I also really enjoyed! In addition to that, I went to some open days and I particularly liked Warwick, I visited the Sanger institute in Cambridge as well where I got to learn a lot of about genome sequencing which was really interesting! It's great to hear that even though the skills you gained weren't necessarily relevant to your degree, you were able to transfer them! At the moment, I'm working on my personal statement and will soon be submitting that along with my UCAS application and I'm also trying to focus on year 13 itself so it's a bit hectic! Do you have any advise on what makes a good personal statement? Or any general advice for someone who wants to go to university?",
