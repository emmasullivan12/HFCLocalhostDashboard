QC their work to make sure it's technically correct before it goes to the client. The supervising part is checking everything in the screening room with the artists and spotting anything they can improve on before it goes to the client. things like is the focus on their elements matching the plate, is they key  working, is the lighting correct. It's not a typical supervisor rile on this show. normally you'd have a lead and a supervisor as separate roles but just combining for this show. Usually a supervisor would go on set too, but not in this case.",
