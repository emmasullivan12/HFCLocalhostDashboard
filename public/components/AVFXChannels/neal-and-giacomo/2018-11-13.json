I just wanted to introduce myself :grin: I’m currently studying VFX at Escape Studios, hoping to go into compositing and move on to be a VFX Supervisor. The number one thing I’ve always wanted to know from a seasoned compositor and freelancer as yourself is what is it like working for many different studios. Are their pipelines different, maybe better than one another. Have you learned anything I might benefit from along the way? Do you have a favourite movie that you worked on? Sorry for the overload of questions but I’m very thankful for this opportunity. Thank you for taking time out of your busy day to do this ",
