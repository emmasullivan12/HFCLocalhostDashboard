When you're early in your career, I recommend you try and do some though, When you first start out, you won't be assigned big shots straight away so it's good to have something on your reel that shows you can handle it. Once you have got some personal stuff on the reel, make sure you show it to someone who is in the industry before you forward it on to any companies. Get them to critic it and show you where you can improve on the shot as there will always be something. Even now as a Lead Compositor, I will still have a review process where I will get others to look at my shot and find errors.",
