This term we have an industry set brief - so that's what I've been working on recently. I'm doing an effects brief for DNEG, and the task is to create two unique magical effects on a rune stone. My first concept is a glowing vein effect, and my second is an electric\/Tesla coil effect. I've done some test renders, so it would be great to get some feedback on how they can be improved! I forgot to hide some particles on the electricity effect though, so please ignore the bubble wrap look on the crystal :sweat_smile:\n\nHere's the link to the renders:\n<https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ipoALE2CaemD0lMpjduZVY6spdKrJieX\/view?usp=drivesdk|https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ipoALE2CaemD0lMpjduZVY6spdKrJieX\/view?usp=drivesdk> \n\nThanks! :blush:",
