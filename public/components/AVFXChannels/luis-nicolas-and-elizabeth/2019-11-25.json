It's a weird one, I seem to be in a sandwich generation of vfx artists; between the old school people that studied art or engineering and those that studied actual vfx carriers in uni. I studied multimedia engineering, back in Colombia, it was a new program as a bit of a mess; by the end of it, I kinda only learned how to use Maya and got an internship in an advertisement post-production house. After a year of being a generalist, I jumped into comp, and been downloaded by that since then. At some point Framestore was doing 47 Ronin and were desperate to grow their comp department, so I was lucky enough to be snatched away from Colombia. I have a bit of computer graphics\/math\/programming background thanks to the engineering side of my career, so that's helped me be a missing link between FX and comp, which has been the main thing I've been doing for the last 7 years or so.",
