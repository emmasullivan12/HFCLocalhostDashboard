She’s a researcher looking at the ways people interact with robots and how they feel a personal connection like they are pets. I remembered the talk this morning when the robot got stuck on the edge of a table and started making sad noises, and I said “Oh, how have you got stuck - this is your own fault, I’ll help you this time but next time you’re on your own” <https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/kate_darling_why_we_have_an_emotional_connection_to_robots\/up-next#t-696558>",

I hope Nigel Shadbolt gives a good talk on AI, you’ll have to let me know what he talks about and whether you find it interesting. He should have something linking big data and AI and the history and future of AI. You might find the stuff on computer vision quite interesting too. Computer vision is an interesting mash-up of AI algorithms and computer graphics algorithms, and its own set of algorithms to together help a computer to see, and is obviously a huge part of self driving cars, robotics and similar AI fields. I’m interested what the digital forensics talk is about and whether you found it exciting. I would guess digital forensics is also about handling big data, but personally I’ve never really looked at what happens in digital forensics.",
