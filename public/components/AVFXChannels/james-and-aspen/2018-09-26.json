I haven’t done much in it, but I did spend a weekend making a really simple game where you picked up coins and it made a “coin collect” noise I recorded on my piano and mixed on Ableton. It was basically a tutorial, but I was happy with it! Python is my favourite language of the ones you listed, I try to practice it as much as I can. Which language do you like best? (Why?) Which universities have you been looking at?\n\nMy placement; we were told we needed to find a 6 month job between our 3rd and 4th years, and I had a good friend I met at Imperial (actually they taught me programming in my first year at Imperial) who worked for Arm, so I asked them if they could help me with the interview and then I had a placement at Arm. I also applied for Google and Lionhead (they were a British game company that made the “black and white” series), but decided I wanted to work for Arm. We had to organise the placement ourselves, but most companies were happy to pay for the 6 months work. Some universities and companies are different with the amount of time you take for the placement (university chooses) and how much the company pays (company chooses). Do you have more questions about placements, I might have missed something that’s interesting to you?",
