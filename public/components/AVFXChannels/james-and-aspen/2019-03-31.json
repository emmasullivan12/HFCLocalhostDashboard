I decided to take a fairly big promotion at work, so I’ve moved back to our head office in Cambridge, and I’m not in Texas any more. I was a bit sad to leave Austin, but at least I’m back in Britain at a nice time of year and the sun has been out all weekend!",

I think it’s one of the worst things about more and more games being locked down, becoming online, having anti-cheat mechanisms built in, and coming as binary blobs on mobile - you can’t change anything about them! I used to like hacking on flash games when they were popular, and wrote tools that let me read and modify game saves for flash games - that was a form of modding too, especially when a game didn’t  validate the save file and you could change things further than the developer intended. I learned a lot from modding and it was some of the most fun I had with programming!",
