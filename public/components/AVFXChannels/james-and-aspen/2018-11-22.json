The office was very quiet yesterday, I think the only people there were people like me who have recently moved to America or are only here for a short time. I finished a big report I’ve spent two months writing and sent it out on Monday... Now that I’ve sent it, I think I might made a big mistake in one of my conclusions and recommendations I made in my report! I’ll have to spend Monday checking over my work, and maybe send out a correction if I got it wrong. I’m a little bit frustrated that I made such a big mistake in front of all my colleagues, but I’m glad I sent the report.",
