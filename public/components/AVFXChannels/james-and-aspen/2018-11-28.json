One is an engineering discussion that I’m not quite managing to convince people that the problem I’ve seen with our code is a big enough problem to fix (it will be expensive to fix), which I’m finding very challenging. The other set of meetings are about my career and what I want to do next. I’m trying to decide between taking a job that needs lots of time talking to customers, and a job that will mean managing an important team.",
