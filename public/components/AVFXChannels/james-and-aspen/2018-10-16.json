Anandtech wrote a good article covering the announcement <https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/13475\/arm-announces-neoverse-infrastructure-ip-branding-future-roadmap> . It means I can be a bit less mysterious about what I’m working on right now; I’m helping decide what features the Zeus processor mentioned on those slides needs. It is very interesting for me; most of my background has been in software before, so I’m learning a lot trying to decide what a processor needs to do.",
