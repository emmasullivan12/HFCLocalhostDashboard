I flew to Portland on Tuesday, we had an 8 hour meeting yesterday, and I’m flying back to Austin today. It was good to meet the customers and make some new business contacts. I’m hoping my team will be able to help them with a few difficulties they discussed with us, and help them to do the right thing. This morning I took the morning off before my flight to go for a walk in the forest near Portland. I like business trips where I get a chance to go see the local area while I’m there. It helps take some of the stress out of the trip.",
