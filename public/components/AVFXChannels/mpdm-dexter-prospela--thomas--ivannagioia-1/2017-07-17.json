If you want we can organise a time to have a chat to make things easier?\nI work for a relatively small company with about 30 people which gives me a lot of autonomy to get on and do my job without someone looking over my shoulder the same time. It doesn't work for everyone as they need to have the structure that a larger company provides but I prefer it. It also allows me time to work on the bar business at the same time.",
