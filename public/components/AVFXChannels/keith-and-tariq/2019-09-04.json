I think I'd like to do a destruction rbd sim. Maybe a procedural house with various materials. Maybe it's a bit cliche but I'm guessing it's a common effect that studios have to achieve right? What do you think?",

You'll have to first do the rbd destruction using bullet or whatever, and then you'll need to add particles with a POP sim and lastly a pyro volume for all the dust.  A good RBD destruction on a reel with all of the elements is a great idea for a reel piece.",
