To be very honest i didnt really enjoy it as it wasnt really enjoyable nd i didnt do anything other than play with children. I think i would like a lab based environment as it would be very enjoyable and a new experience. I think the skills i am quiet strong is working independently, getting on with given tasks nd doing it to the best of my ability. However i really lack in confidence and taking the lead role in activities. I would say im a very shy person especially with new people. ",
