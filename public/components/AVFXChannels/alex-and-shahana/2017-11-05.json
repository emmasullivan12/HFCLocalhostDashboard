It was super interesting and fun but wiped me out haha :sweat_smile: That's good then you have some confidence around people and I think with time and practice of talking to more people then it'll help you! That's very sweet of you I'm glad you've found my advicr useful :grin:. I would say to search for labs in your area and either call or email them to ask if they would be willing to take you on for experience. But if it doesn't work out with them than most places would be useful because it's still experience of working life! You could otherwise look into getting a part time job at a shop\/restaurant if it's an option as that would help too! Have you done any extra curricular stuff also? ",
