It's nice to see different locations so this week were working with one of the companies factories but last week we were doing trials with the university of Munich so it's nice seeing lots of different facilites\/people\/research. It would be great if I could work abroad I would love to work in canada or America or Australia or New Zealand for a year or two at some point in my life! Would you like to work abroad? Revision wise I would say what's helped me the most is doing as many practice questions as possible. Also there's sometimes YouTube videos or interactive websites which i love because it makes it more exciting! ",
