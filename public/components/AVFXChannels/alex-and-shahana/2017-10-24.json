I completely understand the lack of confidence I used to be incredibly shy too (and still am to an extent). With those things its definitely practice talking to new people and putting yourself outside of your comfort zone a bit. Even just pretending you're confident and forcing yourself to talk to new people.. Would you say you ever have a leadership-type role with friends? ",
