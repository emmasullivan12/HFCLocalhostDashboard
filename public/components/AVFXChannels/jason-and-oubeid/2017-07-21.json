Today is the last day of the e-mentoring programme. \nI know we haven't necessarily spoken a great deal, but I hope you have taken some positive points from my messages.\nI'm glad you've opted to read some of John Grisham (will give you a good insight into business (albeit from a fictional perspective)).\nI hope you manage to find a place to intern in between your final year at university and your masters. \nIf you want to get in contact regarding any help, let me know via linked in. My name is Jason Ayton and I work at EY. \n\nMany thanks,\nJason ",
