It follows a graduate straight out of law school... it's not finance, but applies some of the same principles! A good article \/ website for you to read if you're into M&amp;A is <http:\/\/mergersandinquisitions.com|mergersandinquisitions.com>. They have loads of articles from investment bankers, how to get into investment banking and loads of other career options and how to pursue a career in them. \n\nYep, EY is very good... they've paid for further education and the pay is pretty good. \n\nAh right, ok. Just make sure you try your hardest to get an internship at a top bank, professional services firm, fund, etc. inbetween 3rd year and your masters. The earlier you apply (august-September 2017) the more chance you will have if securing an internship for 2018. Apply to as many as you can, to increase your chances.\n\nYes, no worries - my name on LinkedIn is Jason Ayton - working for EY. So just search that :grin:",
