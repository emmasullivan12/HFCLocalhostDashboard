I've been there a few times, it's a great place to be living. \nThat is a very good Major to be studying st University to go into the world of finance. They class Manchester as a \"red brick\" university in the UK, so employers regard it quite highly. \nNice, sounds like you have some good experience under your belt already. Have you tried reading any John Grisham books? They're less financy, but they're fun businessey books with concentrated on law and finance.\n",
