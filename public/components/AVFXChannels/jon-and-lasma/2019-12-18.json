I might possibly shoot some green screen footage since I have the equipment available in my internship. It's quite nice to get inspiration from different studio breakdowns and try to set similar scenes even if in a smaller scale.\n\nAs for voluntary work, London is too expensive so I'd probably do that only if worst came to worst and I couldn't get any jobs after the internship. Hopefully that won't be the case.\n\nDid you find it hard or relatively easy to get in the field and where you want to be?",
