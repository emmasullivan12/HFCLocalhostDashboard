Summer doesn't feel that far away anymore!\n\n Oh that's nice, where are you moving to? :blush:\n \n They're definitely getting some fun projects in!\n From what I saw they didn't specify a deadline so probably just until they have the right people in.. From what I heard they have the project till end of May so who knows. I actually want to go to London but it would be more convenient to move there in September + I'd like to spend the time by the beach this year before moving on to the big city life :smile: but it really depends on work. My contract ends at end of June so I need to start lining up the next new thing for those 2 months. Is it hard to get a vfx job in the summer? \n\nI like my new improved pieces on the showreel, but once I'll put them with the older ones I feel like they won't qualify anymore :sweat_smile: so it's a mixture. I like the old work because it's memories of my uni years but I don't think I should show them to a potential employer just because I think they are not headed in the right direction for what they would look for..\n I'll try and update what I have this week and send you a link. You'll probably agree when you'll see it :smile:",
