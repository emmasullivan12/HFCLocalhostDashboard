I've heard lots of different things on what's going on in vfx atm so at this point I imagine it's gonna be even more of a while to get a job that's for sure.. But what can I do. Will live and see hopefully :)\n\nAUB and BU are still open so I have to go in but all the 1st and 2nd year students are doing just live drawing from home till further notice. Means I don't have to do any demonstrating so I'm practically in just in case someone needs something suddenly. \n\nStay safe!\n\nLasma",
