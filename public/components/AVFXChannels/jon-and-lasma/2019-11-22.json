Then, after a number of years doing other things, I went to an expo of Weta Workshop’s stuff which rekindled my desire to pursue my career in VFX again. (I love The Lord of the Rings! :male_mage:)\n\nI re-acquainted myself with photoshop and eventually took a course at Escape Studios in London. Since then I’ve worked at various studios in London on both film and TV projects as a Compositor.\n\nI am here to help with your showreel, give feedback or generally answer any questions really. Please feel free to ask anything :grin:\n\nI can see you are currently in an internship in Bournemouth. How are you finding that?",

Plus it's great to have time to improve my work before starting in the industry, especially because I've heard from multiple people that it's hard to get a first job straight as a DMP artist.",
