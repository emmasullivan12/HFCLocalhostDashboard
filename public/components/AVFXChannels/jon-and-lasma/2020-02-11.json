I've been doing the dmp tutorials for most of the month and updating one if the projects I already had un the showreel. The internship is going well, I've had a lot more free time which helps with doing the tutorials. At the moment I'm getting my showreel ready for sending to VFX Outpost in Bournemouth. I saw on LinkedIn they have some spots for a 4 to 6 month contract on dmp and environment artist. They have some senior dmp's already so it might be too late but I want to send it anyways. How's work been treating you? :)",

Because I could have sent my showreel as it is ages ago but I wouldn't want to send it yet if I know I can do better now. It's a funny dilemma. What do you think, which one is better?",
