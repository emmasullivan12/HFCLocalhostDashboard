You’re showing a variety of different skills which is really great when someone is reviewing your work.\n\nI don’t think you need to include that it is a graduate reel, or whether it was a solo or group project. It might be better to simply state what you did in the shot. Making things as quick and simple to understand as possible is best.\n\nI can see that you have both compositing and DMP work going on. Have you thought about creating two different reels? It’s often best to tailor your showreel for the position, much the same as you would for a CV. \n\nAre you interested in starting in a compositing role and then moving into DMP? I would agree that it may be difficult to land your first position straight into DMP, especially within a medium to large studio. But this isn’t always the case!\n\nI have done many set extensions and a few matte paintings as a compositor and I know of some compers that almost focus on these types of shots.",
