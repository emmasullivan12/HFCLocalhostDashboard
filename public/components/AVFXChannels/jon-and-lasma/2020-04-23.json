I feel exhausted :laughing: \n\nI think a lot of film and tv projects have gone on hold but not all. There are definitely studios still working. However, most places have furloughed a bunch of people and then the ones still working will be given a lot of work... makes sense. It’s just a difficult situation for everyone at the moment.",

It has been proven by studies that everyone’s productivity will be lower in lockdown and therefore in my opinion the most important thing to do is to to take care of yourself.
