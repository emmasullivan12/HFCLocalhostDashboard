Everything is bizarre at the moment!\n\nUnion has transitioned to working from home which is good but unfortunately a lot of work has been put on hold which means a lot of artists have recently been placed in the government furlough scheme. I have recently fallen into that category and so I’m feeling it is very strange.\n\nWe also have recently been taking care of my grandma as she has had some surgery but with the current situation we have had to get things together and move house pretty quickly.\n\nEverything is settling down now though and everyone seems healthy at the moment which is the most important thing.\n\nHow are you coping with everything? How is the lockdown going on?\n\nI hope you are well and able to stay positive. Let me know if you need any feedback on anything, or simply want to chat. I should have a lot more time on my hands these days!",
