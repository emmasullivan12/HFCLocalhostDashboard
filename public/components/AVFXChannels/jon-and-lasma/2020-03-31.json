Bournemouth streets are really quiet, I live practically in the centre and saw a falcon eating a pigeon yesterday by our doorstep which was bizzare... This is the second week kinda trying to work from home. My job was more face to face though so I'm switching to be more of a technician for teacher technical issues now lol. I'm just lucky I still get paid considering how little I can do for them at the moment.\n\nOther than that I'm actually enjoying the staying home part so it's not that stressful at all. If anything I'm just overwhelming myself with all the dmp challenges and information I've found and now want to go through before they lift the staying at home. I think I'll need to organise a better weekly schedule to be able to go through all of it.. Any tips on time management maybe? Do you think it's better to focus on one thing, finish it and start the next or parallel working like 3h for one thing 3h for another?\n\nHope you don't mind, I invited you in LinkedIn :)",
