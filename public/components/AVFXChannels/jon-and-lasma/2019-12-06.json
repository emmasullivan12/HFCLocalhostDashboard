I went to bachelors for computer animation because I got inspired by a behind the scenes video of an animation film \"Over the Hedge\". I wanted to do little cute characters that felt like they're real. But when I got there I realised I didn't actually enjoy it. I still went through the course trying to find something I could imagine doing in the future but stylised just didn't do it for me. And then in 3rd year we had a few more projects more focused on realistic work and I really loved doing a dmp projection project. After that I completely changed my focus and went for a masters in Digital Effects",
