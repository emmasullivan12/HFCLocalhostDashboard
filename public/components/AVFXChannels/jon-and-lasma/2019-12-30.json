I hope you are having a bit of a break over the holidays.\n\nAs it is coming to the beginning of a new decade (!) it can be good to think about things you want to achieve and then how to get there. Breaking these big goals down into small steps is really helpful too. You’re also able to to take some time and do things well due to your internship which is really great.\n\nKeep in mind that studios look for your skills (how many\/how proficient) and prefer to see studio experience but I think you are ahead of other graduates because of your internship :blush: Most of all however, studios look for a friendly personality and good work ethic.\n\nLet me know how things progress in the New Year. I’ll be glad to help as much as I can with your showreel etc. \n\nI’m back to the studio today to get as much done before the new year as possible! For me, I find it better to put in the extra work before the deadlines get too close although that’s not always an option... a lot of the VFX world can be quite last minute since client changes\/delays are common.\n\nAnyway, I wish you a happy new year! :sparkler: :fireworks: ",
