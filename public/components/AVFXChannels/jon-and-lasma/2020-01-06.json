Sounds like you've been in the studio a lot during the break?\n\nThank you for the link, wish I hadn't missed it - it's already sold out haha. But I'll keep an eye on it just in case they have a start a new one soon! \n\nI've became a fxphd member today so I'm eager to go through as many workshops as I can this month. I find it bizzare how sometimes I feel that the more I learn the more there is I don't know. Do you ever get that when working in a studio or is it just a learning curve? Oddly enough I felt more ready for the industry before the internship started but that might just be the experiences people have shared with me here makes me see it from a wider perspective.\n\nHope you have a great week!",
