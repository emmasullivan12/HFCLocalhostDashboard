I did that for a year or so and then I did animation mentor.\nOf the back of that I got work on an animated feature that never got off the ground :disappointed: and then I moved around doing commercials in London for a little bit\nand did some stints at places like Cinesite in London. Spent a little time doing games and then went back to commercials doing a mix of matchmoving and animation\nand over the course of a year or two transitioned to just doing animation, then I moved to Montreal. Where I worked at Framestore and MPC as a senior animator.\nand eventually moved to Rodeo, where I have been for about 2 years and a half and now I am a lead animator there\n\nhere is my latest reel\n<https:\/\/vimeo.com\/311157609>\n\nId love to hear a little about your path to where you are now, and what you would like to get out of this mentoring.\n\nCurrently i have 3 other mentees on this platform. One is pre university so still making quite broad choices about hwat she wants to do, another is in the final year on uni and wanting to get mroe into character animation, and another who has finished uni but looking to get into the animation work environment.\n\nBut essentially this can be anythign you want it to be.",
