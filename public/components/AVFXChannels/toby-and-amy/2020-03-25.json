I've done a bit of work at Freefolk in London (literally round the corner from Cinesite).\n\nI'm actually going to take a break from working in a studio when I graduate at first, but still going to be animating away on personal stuff, any uni projects that are looking promising after I graduate, and definitely looking at an animation mentor class or two as well.\n\nCurrently just finished my switch to working from home on my final year university project, animating an alien creature!! It's a real challenge for sure. I'm gonna throw some bits together for you to look at and would be awesome if you could spare a couple bits of feedback in your free time. It'll probably be on Syncsketch because it's the friendliest thing I've found so far for reviewing stuff.\n\nThanks so much for offering to be a mentor!! Amazing to get an extra pair of eyes looking at my work especially from someone this experienced. Can't wait!",
