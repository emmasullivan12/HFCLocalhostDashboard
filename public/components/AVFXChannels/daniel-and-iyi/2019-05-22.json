I have been trying to apply for mobile games art and games art positions, with zero feedback and zero progression with my applications. I am currently working on a High Quality Vs Stylised props project, to show off more of what I can do. And I will be going back to the tree and the rocks environment to add the dressing. But it has been difficult to keep my motivation high when I couldn't get feedback or and interview for any Trainee\/intern\/junior positions.",

It's a competitive industry , you just have to keep on working on your skills and eventually you will get in.\nI'm here if you want any feedback etc.\nOne important thing is that you need to make sure you have tailored your portfolio to the job u apply for. If you go for mobile games work you specifically need that type of work on there . If not , then they will probably be a lot less helpful to you.",
