I have filed before and that's not how they looks when crooked,  probably needs to be all straight or a bit crooked in all  axis. \n\nNice damage on tiles. Blue grout is a bit odd but if that's the colour u like then that's cool. Grout needs damage and stains like the rest of the tile. Check references,  it's the first part to get dirty.\n\nThe last one looks smooth. I'd think about what they are made of and why they look and aged this way.\n\nReference is key . You really need to look at the real world examples and try and copy the bits you like, their shape, colour,  texture,  how they fall off , how the light falls on them and bounces off. The more of that stuff you consider I think the better your work will look.\n\nGreat you have been working hard ! Keep it up !",
