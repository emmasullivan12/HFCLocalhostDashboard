Feels like you are quite familiar with this environment,  is this a real bathroom. \nNotes wise;\nIf you put the camera so close to the hooks then I think you need to up res them , as you can see the facets in the outline. \nThe image of the steps outside the window feel lower res than the rest. I guess that's just the hdr sphere. But something to keep in mind. \nAparrt from that I think it's looking lovely and just keep going,  injecting life into it with details. Things like The mirror being perpendicular to the wall ( I have one like that and they always tilt up or down a bit , regardless of how I want it to stay )\nAlso if its going to be a crisp and clean environment this matters less , but if you a are going for reality then the material pass where you grunge it up will make all the difference. \n\nI hope you are enjoying it mate. Keep at it. Im sure once you are done it's going to be great on your show reel.",
