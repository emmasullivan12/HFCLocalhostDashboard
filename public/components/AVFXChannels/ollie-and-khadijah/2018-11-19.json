Great planning skills! \n\nI think if you are looking for work experience as employment (ie paid work) then you will need to complete your CV and apply for job positions.\n\nLook for weekend job positions that you can fit around your study.\n\nA while back you were talking about getting a weekend of part-time job in a hospital.
