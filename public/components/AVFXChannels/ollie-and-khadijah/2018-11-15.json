These have included placements in Florida, South of France (St Tropez), the Greek Islands, the Swiss Alps, Monaco, on a a yacht in Indonesia.....the list could go on. \n\nA typical day for me is just fours, say 9:30am to 1:30pm, tutoring my student one-to-one. We study wherever they prefer in their home - usually a study room or dining room, but sometimes even on a sunny terrace (in Greece) or out in the garden if the weather is nice! If they are losing their focus, we take a break - maybe play a game, or Xbox, or go outside for a bit - whatever brings their focus back to study after. Lunch is always with the family together, or perhaps in a restaurant. After lunch, my work day is done and I am free to do whatever I like for the rest of the day! :) \n\nThis demonstrates that nowadays there are so many different, unusual and spectacular jobs out there, and also that work hours do not have to be typical, fixed 9-5. They can be much shorter, and more flexible - like mine! \n\nAs your mentor, Iâ€™m keen to expand your horizons in terms of what is possible and what is out there! :) ",
