        "text": "I think one of my biggest concerns in my career right now is that I don’t know if I will be prepared for the VFX industry in 2 years. DePaul’s VFX program is still growing, so there are not many VFX-specific classes that are currently offered. I am concerned I will have to continue on at another school which I am not excited about. I would much rather get into the industry and start working and learning there. However I do realize it will be hard to get in with a company without an impressive reel. If you have any thoughts on this let me know but I guess my biggest question might be, how do I know I am qualified enough to start my career in VFX?",
