And there isn't a TON of 2D animation happening in London, it's mostly VFX here. I can update my vis dev portfolio pretty easily because I can use Procreate on my iPad. But as for updating my animation reels, it's a struggle...especially for 3D animation. But I'm still trying. I'm thinking of applying to the masters program at Gobelins back in Paris if I can afford it",
