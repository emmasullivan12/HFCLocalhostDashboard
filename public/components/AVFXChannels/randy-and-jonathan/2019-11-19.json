I actually graduated in 2018 so I'm technically not a student anymore and I got a short term contract at a small studio as a 2D animator, but I haven't been able to find any work since. So now I'm trying to continue to update my portfolio\/reel as much as I can from my laptop and tablet since I don't have access to my uni's computer lab anymore because I live in London now",
