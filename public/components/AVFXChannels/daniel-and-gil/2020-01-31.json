Honestly,  you seem to really have the eye. \nI will dig deeper a little later , when I have a moment,  but first I just wanted to manage your expectations regarding how I can help you. I am an animator,  have been only that for about 14 years now , so my eye is trained for things relevant to animation and I wont be of much help in other areas. In saying that though,  just looking at your work I can see you have some talent for posing , which is a lot about what animation is.\n\nI catch up soon. You be up for a Skype chat some time? Or prefer just chat ?",
