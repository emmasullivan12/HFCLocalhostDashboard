I sent my intern application in on Friday for Freefolk in time for the initial deadline, although they just extended until the 3rd of May so hopefully I can get those changes made on my reel. The application just asked this question: About you: Add a short statement about you and why you want this placement. My response; I am due to graduate from Escape Studios in May where I have truly found my passion whilst studying 2D Visual Effects. My last project Offcut, working within a small team was challenging and rewarding and it has won multiple awards.\nI want the Internship as I admire the great and award winning work that is created by Freefolk across both Film and TV. It would be a brilliant opportunity to learn and work amongst your artists building new skills.   \nIt would be great to send you some details and be on the record in case anything comes up. Is there anything else I should send through to you other than a reel and CV?",
