I have a website at <https:\/\/www.chloeoconnor.com\/> where I have posted some personal work, and a bit of the work I’ve done on my traineeship. My main focus would be on 3D modeling\/texturing, and I’ve stuck to a very cartoony, animation focused style so far. I’ve been looking to do more realistic stuff though, since learning Substance Painter on my placement, and taken a course in advanced 3D modeling. Let me know when suits you best to message, I’m sure you’re busy in the studio during the day!",
