I was thinking about taking Biology, Spanish and PE at college because I really enjoy them all and I think they link well with physiotherapy. I think the Spanish could link well as it can allow me to go abroad whilst working etc. Whilst the biology and PE would obviously link aswell as I am thinking of doing more sports therapy than just any physiotherapy. :)",
