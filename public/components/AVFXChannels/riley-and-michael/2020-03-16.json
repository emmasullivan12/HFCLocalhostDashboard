I've only worked at Framestore for about 2 years, but I've enjoyed it so far. I'm in the NYC office, and we mostly work on commercials but have recently made a big push to do episodic work. I applied as a runner out at Framestore of college, then worked that job for abpout 3 months. It was mostly getting people coffee, cleaning, etc. but was a great way to meet people. Then, I did a 3 month internship at Framestore in the asset department. They were pretty busy at that time, so luckily I got the chance to work on a lot of projects. I freelanced at a small studio for about a month after that, and a few months later was contacted by a recruiter about a staff role in the assets department at Framestore.",
