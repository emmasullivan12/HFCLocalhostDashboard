I think the biggest difference is that in most small studios in the city, they typically don't have staff asset people so when I was freelancing, I didn't have anyone to learn from. At framestore it's nice to have 4 other asset people who I can ask questions and bounce ideas off of. I think bigger studios are more accustomed to doing a lot of 3D work as well so they are more reasonable with scheduling. For example I think sometimes in smaller studios producers don't realize that CAD data from a client can't just be instantly fixed to make it production friendly. So i think I prefer bigger studios, but the major drawback is that I think it takes a longer to move up at a bigger studio and the responsibility and creative input takes a lot of years to gain",
