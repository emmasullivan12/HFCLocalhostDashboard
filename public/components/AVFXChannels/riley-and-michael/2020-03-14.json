And I would like to work on bigger projects with bigger team so I am considering moving on to bigger production companies like The mill, Blur Studios or even Framestore. But I am wondering if there are any specific steps I should take, pitfalls I should avoid and I would also love to hear about your own path and how you are seeing your future at Framestore as well as your career.",
