But yeah, I am sure Asset department must be really fun, I started as a modeler and it is still my favorite thing to do.  You are right that smaller studios often don't have the proper scheduling, workforce, nor the budget the bigger studios have. This is why I feel that my experience wouldn't be taken as seriously at a big studio and that I would need to start from the bottom again. Have you met any Sup or Lead at Framestore that was coming from a smaller studio? Also would you say you are earning a comfortable\/competitive salary for NY?",
