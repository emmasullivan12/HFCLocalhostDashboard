I will definitely follow it. \nBournemouth was great! I loved the place and the campus, and the program sounds amazing as well. It is quite funny because I have everything ready to apply, but I thought I might give it a try applying for jobs at the same time as the masters, thinking I might not get any answer. So I was very surprised! and obviously happy. Anyway I will apply for the masters just in case as to have an option B :)  \n",
