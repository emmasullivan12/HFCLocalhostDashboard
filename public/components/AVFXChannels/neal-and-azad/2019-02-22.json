I'd done the odd bit of leading here and there, but when I joined the company I'm at now, they wanted to make me more into a lead artist, setting up nuke scripts and tech checking other artist shots to ensure they are technically correct before we send to client. The role involved with a little bit of supervising on the smaller shows when necessary too, so, 2 of the last 4 projects I've supervised.  I'm fairly new to it, but enjoying it. The thing with this industry is you will constantly learn new things.",
