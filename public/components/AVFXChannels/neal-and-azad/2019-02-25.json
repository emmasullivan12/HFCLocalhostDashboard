At the moment I have just been working towards my final project and soon I shall be using nuke, I'm making a little VFX shot called kitten Kong and it's using my cat In front of a green screen and comping her into a street shot, I made a really rough \"previs\" using stock cat footage and old footage from another assignment, I can show you both if you wouldn't mind taking a look at them! But it's really cool how you are constantly learning something new it really drives the passion into continuing in VFX ",
