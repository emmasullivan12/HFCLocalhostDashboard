Currently im still chilling at the moment as I'll be working with lidar next year so I'm trying to find some part times, apart from IT part times do you know any good VFX part time jobs?

Have you tired looking at a website called <http:\/\/peopleperhour.com|peopleperhour.com>? it's a freelance site and you bid to do work for someone. it could be a photoshop design or animation and i've seen people ask for comp work on there now and again. it's worth checking out to see what's on there",
