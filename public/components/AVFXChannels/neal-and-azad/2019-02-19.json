Currently I am making a final project that it's mainly nuke heavy, maybe I could show you? I also have a few questions too relating to VFX, companies and even you as an individual in this field, there's 8 questions in total, just to gain more insight, it's cool if all of them are not answered but I would be grateful nevertheless. And maybe taking a look at what I'm doing for my final might be cool? Checking out my concept and my nuke script if you don't mind? ",
