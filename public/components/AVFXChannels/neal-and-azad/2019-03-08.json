But wow sounds like you have had quite the journey and funny enough we both had the same starting point of interest in 3D and it's cool how a runner finds his way, generally it's like you would need the determination in this industry and the keen will to learn and that's also funny to hear because personally I have mentally worked on myself to improve my determination for most tasks at hand, it gets very psychological but most of it has been through self development, I'm curious to know as to what feeds your determination, what your passion is but I'm guessing it's to do with how cool shit looks and as you said being your own worst critic but is there anything you like to do in your chill time? Get a drink, games etc what are you most passionate about on a personal level, apart from VFX? The driving force behind the wheel? ",
