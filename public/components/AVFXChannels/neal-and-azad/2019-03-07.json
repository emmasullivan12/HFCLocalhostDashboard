If you look at something close up, your eye naturally blurs out the things around it, but not it the way a camera lens would. if you look at a bokeh blur, its an effect you've seen a thousand times, but you would worry if your eye was doing that, but when you see it on a screen you do not question it.",

Typically, if I'm leading a project, I'd come in and first look at any client notes that have come in over night. Then with my coordinator, we'd do whats called rounds. We'd go to each artist working on the job and explain the notes they need to address and help them if they don't understand how to fix it. Then I'd go back and address any notes I have on my own shots. throughout the day I'd have artist coming up to me asking question about how to do something and then at a certain time everyday we have whats called a dailies session. This consist of going into our mini cinema room and watching all the shots then have been rendered that day. I'd either give notes to further improve the shot or pass it as a final to go to the client. Then I do whats called tech checks where I check if any shots that are finaled by the client are technically correct, i.e check the grain, the mattes, make sure the roto is fine, colours are correct, black point and white point are corrrects etc...",
