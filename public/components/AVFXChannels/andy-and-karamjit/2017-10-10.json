        "text": "I went to Napier in Edinburgh. I chose the degree because it included industrial training as a compulsory part of the course. I spent two Summers’ working for an electronic design company. It was good as it helped me decide that electronic design engineering wasn’t for me. I took an interest in their manufacturing and hence I decided to go into manufacturing engineering but within the electronics industry. I would certainly recommend doing an engineering course that enables you to get into industry to see what it is all about. ",
