Hope you had a lovely weekend?\n\nNot personal at all, I think diversity (or lack thereof) is a very hot topic in the industry and we're definitely talking about it a lot more. I found it strange when I used to work in retail where it was predominantly women to come into this industry and feel like a minority. But I think I'm quite lucky in that I've helped shape the recruitment process here to try and attract more women. I think we're at 30% (or just under) and because we're a small studio I don't feel like I don't have any allies? I've never felt like a 'token' but I have definitely had to toughen up a bit and be a bit more forceful if I want something done, just so I felt like I could be taken seriously.

I think as long as you're aware of what you could be facing and if you can't find allies in the workplace, make an effort to find some outside. There are loads of meetups, Slack channels and events that are safe spaces for women :slightly_smiling_face:",
