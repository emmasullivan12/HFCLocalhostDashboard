It seems to have enough quirks, annoyances, and general bits that go wrong with little reason that I'd forsee my trying to work in Maya for modelling all day as being my bashing my head into a wall constantly. My tutors say that the constant annoyance with Maya is mainly a student thing; apparantly 'in industry' it works a lot better (assumedly down to either using service packs or on-site troubleshooting, I'd assume?) Is it true, and I just need to get used to Maya and it will eventually stop biting back, as it were?\nI think eventually I'll have to accept the degree of uncertainty, I suppose. Or decide on a path to follow. I'm certainly looking to improve on most areas (the first year of University seems to be a lot of 2D stuff mixed in, which eats up the vast majority of my time for work that I'm not too big a fan of, which leaves precious little time to do much more than the class excercises for modelling etc. (The rocket engine exhaust is the only real personal project I've had time to do since starting, and that was for the Rising Star competition, and was done in 3 days). I'm certainly looking forwards to summer.\nWould you pick any software that's good to know aside from Maya, Photoshop, Mari, Nuke, and Substance, or anything that's on the rise I should look out for\/in to? From what I can see, Max seems to be quite present still in job listings (especially for games), but I'm told by tutors that they see Max as dying out, and thus a bit of a dead end.
