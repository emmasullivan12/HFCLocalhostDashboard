You won’t necessarily need those skills as an entry level unless you want to take that route as a main job - a developer.\n\nPython is by far the la guage we use the most in the industry. In some more advanced projects C++ is used too.\n\nWhat sort of file management software? Or is it just mentioning file management in general?  In these cases I believe you get to learn in the job. Each company has their own way of handling the gigantic ammount of files we deal with every day.",
