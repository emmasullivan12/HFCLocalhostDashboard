Being a die hard survival horror fan I have chosen to do a Silent Hill piece. I am making the Janitor, Pyramid head and the nurses for the shot. Could you do point me to some good tutorials to get the wall peeling effect? pretty sure its a job for houdini as it seems to be the best for simulations and dynamics.\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/snLNPt9H5J4>",

        "text": "My Time is running out to enter the industry as I will be 38 years old this year.  I don't feel ready for retirement just yet though. After learning computer graphics for almost six years now I am a bit too committed and have much to offer. Ageism is in the industry though.  Maybe I should make this shot easy for myself and just perfect the peeling environment. before moving onto the rigs. I know I am capable of creating all this, However I know its going to take a lot of time. One thing at a time I think. I think this will look good in UE4. I have render farm credits to use. UE4 is still not going to light the scene as beautifully as an offline render like Arnold so I would still like to do that first as a kind of concept pass. My Goal is to try and sell myself to a games studio known as supermassive games.",
