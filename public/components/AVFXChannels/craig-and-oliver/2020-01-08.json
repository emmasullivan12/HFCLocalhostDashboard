Only recently found out what has been wrong with me all my life. My siblings have been trying to tell me all my life lol. I tend not to think like normal people. I think it gets on peoples nerves as well. It does make life more complicated I think. So it looks like getting myself well versed in vellum should answer questions. Thanks dude!",
