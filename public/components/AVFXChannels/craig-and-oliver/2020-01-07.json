        "text": "Hey Craig, literally no tutorials on what I am trying to do. I want to create a burnt skin peeling effect for the janitor . I thought i'd see if I could simulate it in Houdini. Not for a simulation but for the model. I'm thinking along the lines of fracturing the surface only and then then I need the mesh to kind of peel and shrivel up while sticking to the surface. If I try sculpting this it ends up looking a little stylized. I want realism, believable. I'll post a shot when I get close to the desired effect. Maybe the Vellum solver might work as well. Never seen anybody do this before and that's why I think its a cool challenge.",
