I have a little time over December I hope. I am going to try an achieve a whale jump and splash in Houdini. It will probably be my own Rig. After I have achieved this photo real shot in Houdini, I will then try and port it to UE4 and show a comparison on my reel. Hope you are still up for being my Mentor.",
