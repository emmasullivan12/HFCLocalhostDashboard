We want to say that we have really enjoyed having you be part of our Summer E-Mentoring Pilot Study and hope it has been a useful experience for you!\n\nWe now just need you to complete this quick debrief form (Link is here: <https:\/\/prospela.typeform.com\/to\/zlsegL>)\n\nWe want to hear your *HONEST* opinion about the experience. We'll be using your feedback to help us build the product in the future so don't tell us \"It was great\" if you didn't feel that way! \nDon't worry, you won't hurt our feelings :smiley:\n\nWe'll be able to show you your progression over the programme too!\n\nMany thanks for this in advance :bowtie:",
