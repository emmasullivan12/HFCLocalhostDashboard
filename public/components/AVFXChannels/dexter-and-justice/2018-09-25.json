I’m glad I took the risk. \n\nYeah, I go an A* in maths for GCSE. I enjoyed maths the most out of all the subject I did which is the reason I want to do accounting.\n\nSo far I’m thinking about doing an economics degree at Kent next year but I feel like I’ve been limited in my options as to where to go for university because so many require alevels maths. I don’t know much about apprenticeship because I’ve always been pushed to go to uni. \n\nI’m kind of such on the work experience aspect of completing my personal statement because I don’t know any places to get work experience for someone applying for an economics degree.",
