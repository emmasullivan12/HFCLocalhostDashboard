        "text": "Hi Maria, just been checking out your animation, it's looking great! :grin: You've clearly been applying animation principles and the story is well told by the animation itself.\n\nThe hair animation and rendered shadows are impressive, both of these are great for adding a professional look. Adding really subtle hair animation to each shot adds some dynamic interest so I'd recommend making it consistent throughout. Keep it nice and subtle.\n\nAs far as constructive criticism, I would use straight cuts between shots instead of fades, they make it difficult to focus on your work. I certainly get it if you don't want to make the run time too short, but if you were thinking of adding another shot, i'd definitely add an expository shot of the bee on its own, on the wall or coming through a window.",

If you have the ability to increase the contrast of the eye texture (pupil isn't dark enough and colour a little washed out), though this is just a personal preference I would change myself if it was my work!",
