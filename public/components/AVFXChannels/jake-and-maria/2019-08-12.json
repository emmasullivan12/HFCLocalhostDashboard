Was this for a module at SAE? Two suggestions I have are: 1. Instead of wireframe mode for turntables, try  using wireframe on shaded as your model will be easier to appreciate this way. 2. The easiest way to improve how professional your model looks would be to add \"normal\" and \"specular\" maps, to give you really nice control over the shading of the model. Just some ideas, should they be helpful!",
