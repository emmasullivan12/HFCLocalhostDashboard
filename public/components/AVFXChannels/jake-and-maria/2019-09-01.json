Both were really awesome for talks about cutting edge games\/vfx\/VR, and lots of networking opportunities and getting reel feedback. Haven't actually been to much in London so I'm not much help there.",

The only thing to consider is if you wanted to be an environment artist for example it'd be best to vary your projects so your reel has some variety. If you want to be a character artist though, focusing on character design and modeling is perfectly fine.",
