Just life happened.\nSo, it was the Festive season, and I was back home. It was wonderful to spend a New Year with my family first time for 5 years; as I had to stay here and work in previous years. It was wonderful in the beginning but then so much happened that I was so ready to come back. The saddest thing was that I lost my dog. It happened just a day before New Year.\nAnd you know, back then I told myself - \"It's life. Things happen. Everyone leaves one day. It's okay\"... I thought.\n\n\nThen I got back, and I had that trip to Rome straight after. It was so rapid, that I had no time to process everything that happened back home. But after, when I had some time alone - this is when it hit me â€” destroyed entirely. Even psychology couldn't help in this situation. I was offside for a month. I just had some energy for lectures, work and that's it. Rest of the time I spent in bed.\n\nI've tried to let you know a few times. But every time I was about to type, it ended up there.\n\nPretty much this is the story behind my absences.\n\nI hope that everything is going okay for you. That all deadlines are sorted and I hope that Lauren successfully moved into her new house.",
