This course is a mash of 2 different departments. And there is a serious miscommunication between them.\nI've raised my concern about that with my course leader - they totally agree and don't deny it. Moreover, they know about the problem.\n\nWe are guinea pigs. We're told that directly. During the conversation between me (as a course rep) + (and some student) and a lecturer. It was said without offence to anyone. It's it is good to know the real state of things.\n\nSo, the whole course is in the process of being rewritten. Which is perfect.

However, no one explained how to implement them in a _CG environment_; or how to utilise the _Graph editor (Maya)\/Curve editor (3ds max)._\n\nWe used _Maya_ a few times throughout the last year. I've tried to speak to lecturers previous year, but no actions were taken. *As a result:* students don't know how to use _Maya_, they are frightened of only mentioning it.\n\nThis year, our lecturer (from one department) was very surprised when he found out (in September) that we didn't use _Maya_ previous year as he expected us to create 60-second animation with 2 characters interaction in _Maya._\n\nEven now all we've done is using _CAT-rigs_ in _3ds max_ to make simple animations - walk cycle, run cycle and etc.\n\nSo, I've spent my own money and 1,5 months to buy tutorials and learn _Maya_ myself. Now I'm confident using it; knowing how to utilise every vital aspect of the app to animate effectively. (at least for the present day; it's much more to learn)",
