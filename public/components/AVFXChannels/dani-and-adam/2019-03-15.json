Took some time, but I'm back on track.\n\n*˜* Are you enjoying uni projects at all?˜*\nTbh - yes and no. Yes, because it's a knowledge that is useful in a way (I'll explain). No, because at a certain degree it is a waste of time, that could be used for more helpful stuff.\n\nFor example, now we have to RIG characters using CAT Rigs. Is it useful? Yes in a way. Will I rig models using CAT rigs in general - I don't think so. I'd go for a proper RIG instead of CAT Rig (which has many limits).\n\nIt's all done to prepare us and make diverse when it comes to the collab project — jack of all trades, sort of.",

Yes, it all sounds ridiculous. I don't expect to hear back from them. At least now, with the skill I have. I want to let them know that exist. That was an idea in the first place.\n\nThe fact that I know, what I'm capable of and restriction that life puts on me stress me out. I have all the tutorials I need, and I have a clear vision of how my work will look like and what I'll be able to do. However, due to сonventions and responsibilities that hold me back - I am where I am.\n\nIt was tough to send the showreel I have, without having the energy to fix it. You told me what exactly had to be fixed. I should do it.\nI'll try to get it sorted for SuperSpline portfolio at least.\n\nDon't get me wrong please - I have no one to blame than myself. It just me.\n\nIt was hard to accept, but I understand that I may not get any placement with my current skill this year.",
