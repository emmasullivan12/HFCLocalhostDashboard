However, I’ve tried to use these 1,5 months with great benefit for myself. I was not only learning Maya, but I was also learning good working habits and was looking at different pipelines\/work approaches. How to make an animation from blocking down to final refined piece; or how to speed up the process without loosing in quality.\nThere are still many things for me to learn (they are on my list), but that was an excellent start to build a strong foundation.\n\nSadly, most of it is not taught at university. Some bits and bobs are – but without someone experienced with a good explanation it’s hardly possible to make a system out of it in your head as a student.\n\nMy main concern is time. I could spend it making an actual animation. But instead, I had to learn on the side to get the required knowledge for my work. And I’m now left with 2 weeks for projects that usually takes 2 months at least (if I want to get a good and refined result). But I’ll come to this later.",

The education system in Estonia is built in a slightly different way than in England. We finish with 12 grades. I have no right to compare difficulty level with the UK because I did not study here (elementary, middle or high schools). But from my experience education is very intensive. We end up with 16 subjects in general (in our diploma). Some subjects we finish in 9th grade and they transfer from the end of middle school down to the high school (we call it gymnasium) diploma. At least that was the case back in 2012. A severe reform of education followed this. So, I’m not entirely sure how things are going now.\n\nAnyway, after graduation, we are eligible to apply for higher education (without a need to go to college).\n\nAgain, I don’t have a right to discuss that, as I have never been in college. But I think it is a necessary and useful step (bridge) between secondary and higher education; as it prepares you for your future career.\n\nAs an example – I should feel that gap by taking a foundation year at university, instead of going to college.\nSo, the college is a good step on the way to higher education (it’s only my subjective opinion).",

That, on the other hand, makes me worry about the time I have at university to do all that, but I’ll make it. At least I try to make it!\nNext steps will be to learn – Body Mechanics, then Acting, the Advanced acting, then facial animation. I have materials to learn from (tutorials, videos and books). It’s a matter of time only. On top of that, I want to learn more about psychology behind animation. I mean, for example, what stands behind our perception of the strong or weak character. What are these signals that tell observer about it? Another simple example are the shapes – rounded body shapes, squared or triangled. These things already send a signal (subconsciously) to a viewer about who is the character.\n\n_ “The devil is in the detail”. _\n\nI have not been going back home for Christmas or the New Year for past 5 years. So, this December, after the end of the 1st semester I’ll start on Body Mechanics.\n\nSo, hopefully, after that I’ll be able to bring to the screens a believable character motion.",

        "text": "I bought myself a drawing tablet 2 years ago as this was a requirement for _Photoshop_ module on the foundation year). Afterwards, I didn’t use it because we were doing a lot of hard surface modelling and traditional\/stop-motion animation.\n\nHowever, recently I have discovered a video of an animator who described his experience working with a tablet - when he was a student and when he got his first job. He says when you get used to it, it’s like touching a model with your own hands. And most important – it speeds up the workflow in many times!\n\nI have a vertical mouse, which is more physiological. Ergonomics of that computer mouse helps to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome. However, it’s still a mouse. So, I was curious about the possibility of utilising a drawing tablet and get into the habit. What do you think about that?",

Post stuff in social media, etc.\nSo, not that much to do with animation.\nA bad example -  my acquaintance (from Estonia), who finished Bradford University in Biomedical Science decided not to take a placement\/internship and therefore didn’t find a job afterwards. She was looking for 6 months and then gave up.\nPlacement\/internship is essential. It’s clear to me.\n\nWhat I’m concerned about is:\n*  it’s not much to do with animation.\n* my animation skills will fade away withing the time\n* it’s not paid\nI’m fine with not get paid. I have to start somewhere. However, it’s London. It’s expensive.\nI’m not saying that I’ll get it. I’m just trying to figure out is it worth it if any of the same position will appear in the future.\nI entirely depend on myself, and I have savings. However, I’m trying to figure out the next:\n\nThis position – is it worth spending time and money on it?",
