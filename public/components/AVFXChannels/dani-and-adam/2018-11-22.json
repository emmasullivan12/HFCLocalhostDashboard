And I have done dancesport (ballroom dancing) for 9 years.\n\nBut there is one particular thing, that made my mind up to become an animator and it’s - 9 (2009 animated film). This film has a special place in my heart. It was like a wake-up call. It’s hard for me to put that into words. But that was a moment when I decided to become an animator. And it was 9 years ago.
