Apparently, it's a complex of plugins that help to work on animation and assets using Unreal and Maya. Handy thing (cos it can be a pain in the ass to transfer between these two).\nCurrently, I'm using Animbot. A great thing without doubts. It can do a lot. It used to be free as it was on the beta for more than a year. Now it's finally released. Without speaking too much, here is all possibilities in short animations. It's easier to show, rather than list them all.\n\nJust scroll down (every option listed):\n<http:\/\/www.animbot.ca\/tooltips\/>\n\n150 ways to Animate faster in Maya\nSame thing, but in a video (very fast paced):\n<https:\/\/animbot.ca\/home\/>",

It's essentials to learn how to draw anatomically-correct and realistic faces before you start drawing caricatures.\nI may be wrong, but this is how I see it. (If I'm, please let me know. As I continually restructure knowledge inside my head. Moreover, what is relevant today may be obsolete tomorrow)\n\nAs you said - be open and ready. I totally agree with that! So well told!\n\nAbout astrology - if you trust me your date of birth I can say much more. I know it's very impolite to ask how old is a lady. So I won't :smile: All that's needed is the day and a month. Like 7 of August for example.",
