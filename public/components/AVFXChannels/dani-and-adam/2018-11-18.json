I didn't study games animation (tbh, I wonder why it's differentiated from just 'animation' xD) but I started my career in games after studying 3D Computer Animation! I have worked on some top titles (including at Cubic Motion so I know that company well!) Do you have to create a game as part of your course? I've always just been 'just' an animator ^-^",
