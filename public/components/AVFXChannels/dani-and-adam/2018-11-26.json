I got to work on some seriously cool titles, like Halo 4 and Wolfenstein and Injustice: Gods Among Us. I have worked on so many titles I sometimes forget them!!! I started my career working on Grand Theft Auto IV, many MANY years ago now (sooo oooold) What I didn't enjoy was the structure of the company at the time. It might have changed now, but there was a culture of working long hours and working on literally anything that needed doing, everyday was different and I often felt like I was swimming in the dark. I much prefer a linear, organised pipeline on a project that is planned by a production team ^-^ This is all my own experience and opinion of course, and I know people that have been with them for 9 years!!",
