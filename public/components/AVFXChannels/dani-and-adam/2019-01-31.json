I'm now working with MoCap, Motion Builder and Unreal - not precisely an animation, and it's more technical animation - but it has to be done.\n\nI'll try to apply for a summer internship at Super Spline studios. It looks incredible from different perspectives. I'm not sure when is the best time to apply.\n\nAs a company owner, do you think that it's better to apply earlier or improve (if possible) an animation skill and apply closer towards the end?\n\n\n\nThank you! :slightly_smiling_face:",
