Independent life in another country, when all decisions are on your shoulders, taught me a lot.\n\nAt university, I work as a Residence Life Coordinator. I am working to help students get the most out of their time with a focus on student welfare, as well as planning and running seasonal events and workshops.\n\nIn addition to that, I am my course representative. I am kind of a bridge that connects student voices on one side and university on the opposite side. Our course is only two years old as it was recently launched. Much can be improved regarding the structure, and this is what I work on. Apart from that, I have a part-time job.\n\nManaging all that sometimes is hard. However, I keep a healthy lifestyle. I do not smoke, do not do drugs, barely drink, became a vegan recently. All that does not prevent me from socialising. I am a responsible and independent person, however a team player.\nIt probably sounds like a paradox, but in this industry, where one product is the work of a group of people - it is a basis.\n\nI am ready to work a lot, and I am not afraid of difficulties. I did not have an easy life. However, I am now building the life I would like to have. Work and self-development is a movement up; movement up is self-development.",
