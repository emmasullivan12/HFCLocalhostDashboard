I really wanted to do A-Levels but I couldn’t pass my English language (D) which lead me to choose BTEC Business but also happy as it will give me 3 A-Levels at the end of the course. \nIm not very confident neither loud as dont talk much in my class but do sometimes and sometimes feel that my English is bad so I decide not to talk and not giving answers which also leads me to lose my confidence when im doing presentation (i heard that you are PowerPoint Ninja) so i would like to learn from you. \nI am organised but very slow when it comes to my coursework as first i do research and write it down in a piece of paper and after type in so that all takes more time but i want my work to be clean, nice and understandable.\nI dont know “enterpreneurial” and creative in like what?",
