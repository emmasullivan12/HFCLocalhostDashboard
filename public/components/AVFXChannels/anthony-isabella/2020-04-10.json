I'm now at Framestore London, in the IA branch (formerly named Commercials). My initial plan was to switch back to the movies branch in June\/July but with this pandemic that I'm sure you've heard of, schedules are slightly affected and the position I was eyeballing will probably not be available anymore. We'll see.\nI have a showreel if you're curious, happy to share if you want to see it.\nI'm working remotely for the past 3 weeks and try to always keep an eye on slack\/emails and all, feel free to reach anytime you need or want.\n\nThat's for me, if you have any question, please shout :slightly_smiling_face:",
