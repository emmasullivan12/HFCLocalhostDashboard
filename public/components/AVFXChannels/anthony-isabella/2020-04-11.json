So I'll give you an overview as well.\n\nI moved to London 5 years ago to study because where I am from in Italy creative careers aren't seen as something serious or even possible so I wanted to follow my passions and see if there was a different way of thinking.\n\nI graduated in 2018 from the University of Greenwich where I achieved a First Class BSc Degree in Creative Digital Media. I'm attaching my CV for details.\nI enjoyed the course because it gave me an overview of what was available out there. I mostly enjoyed the 3D animation courses that we did and for my dissertation, I decided to investigate more and learn Houdini by myself, it wasn't part of the course and my teachers didn't know what it was, but while I was learning it with online tutorials I realized that it was the only software that allowed my to achieve what I wanted for my final project and it's still is the best for me, so I also didn't look back since then.",

What would be your goals in this industry?\nYou mentioned 3D animation and made your dissertation on fluids simulations. There's a mention of compositing in your CV as well. Are you predominantly interested in FX or are you keen on any other domain?\nFinally, what would be your expectations with this e-mentorship?",
