Ask all of those _juicy_ questions about work life that you've wanted to know as well as soak up the tips and secrets that your mentors have learned throughout their years of experience!\n\n:point_right:*Your challenge for this week* is to complete the 3rd and final section of your career plan with your E-Mentors by Wed 19th July. Now that you've discovered a bit about what you'd like to do and what work life of your E-Mentor is like, use the last section to lay out the road ahead and the steps you can start taking today to get you where you need to be! As before, use the question prompts we've listed to get the answers you need from your E-Mentor!\n\nMake the most of your E-Mentors whilst they are still ready and waiting to help you through the Prospela platform!\n:muscle::muscle::muscle:",
