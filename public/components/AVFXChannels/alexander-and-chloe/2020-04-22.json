Work is super busy right now (which is a good thing I guess :P).\nOh yeah, I remember seeing the review of your bee Jesus Fernandez did on his Facebook channel. I'm one of his patreons as well! For the longest time he was pretty much the only one offering good groom tutorials online but thankfully that has improved a lot in recent days.\nThis mentorship can take any shape or form you would like. I'll be happy to take a look and critique your work, share some tips, help you solve issues or just answer questions about the industry.\nDo you have a long term goal for your career in the industry?",
