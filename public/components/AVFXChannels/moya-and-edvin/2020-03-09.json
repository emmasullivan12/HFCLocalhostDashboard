I’m working in advertisement production as production coordinator at the moment and want to move to post production \/ VFX. But I’ve never worked in VFX post house before, so I guess I’m trying to understand how post production works in general, how it’s developing and changing in the last\/coming years and what opportunities there are in the industry at the moment. \nI would be more than happy to jump on a call to introduce myself further if you want. :) again, thanks for your help ",
