Apologies for not replying sooner.\n\nIt fully depends on what companies you are looking at joining.\nFor example, If it's framestore my understanding is that they look for a mix between realism and character work, so it would be good to have a few motion studies (animal and human) and character work (dialogue, pantomime) pieces.\nThat's amazing that you have work experience in framestore already, as that's a great way of getting your name known!",

        "text": "This mix tends to be a hit for multiple places, including studios that involve a more cartoon work flow, if you want to apply to those studies I would add a piece that's more exaggerated into your reel.\n\nBut like I say, it fully depends on what company\/area of animation you're looking to join.\nMy recommendation would be to look at some credits of films that you'd like to have worked on, grab a few names and try and find their reels. Some people will have their university reels on their account\/reels from applying to the companies, and they would be good starts to looking into it further.\n\nDo you have companies in mind?",
