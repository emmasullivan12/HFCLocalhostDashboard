Hope the new phone is fantastic.\n\nThat sounds like a great plan of action, what companies have you looked into? I can see if I can find out more about them if you like?\nAlso, if you have any shots you'd like me to critique, please feel free to send them to me.\n\nHope you're having a great time in uni!",
