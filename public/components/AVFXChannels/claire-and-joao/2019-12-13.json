I studied Film back in Portugal about 10y ago and I'm now finally going for a career in animation and VFX. When it comes to questions, I'm not quite sure. I worked at the Framestore for a few months last year as an IT Support Runner, and it really made me want career in animation. So I have a bit of an idea of how it works. This year at Uni I'm really trying to get the most out of it and build a showreel. If you think of any advice on what to include and what companies normally like to see in one, I'm really interested.",
