Had no notifications about it! I’m really sorry I’ve not replied, you must think I’m really not invested. I promise I am! We got a bit of an extension on the group project, but then ended up not handing in a final product due to Covid19. We were marked on the work we did before then, but I managed to finish all the animation, so might still have something for my showreel. I’m now using this time to work on my spring project. I did look at the blue zoo internship and the framestore’s launchpad and a few others, but didn’t apply as I’ll have to work on my final project during the summer and I’m not sure I can dedicate the full time to an internship. \n\nHow are you doing? Are you keeping safe? Was work able to set you up working from home? All the best.",
