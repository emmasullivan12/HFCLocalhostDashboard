Accountants usually have no problems finding work and get paid very well. \n\nTo become an Accountant, the most typical route is to study an undergraduate degree (in anything) and then complete the ACCA or ACA after graduating from University. \n\nIf you can get the ACCA or ACA qualification paid for by an Accountancy company, and take the qualification while simultaneously working, that is most ideal. Normally takes three years. \n\nI know quite a lot about this route into Accountancy. Feel free to ask me any other questions on this! :) \n\nCan I ask where you are at now? Are you in Sixth-form? Which qualifications and subjects are you taking?\n\nOllie :) ",
