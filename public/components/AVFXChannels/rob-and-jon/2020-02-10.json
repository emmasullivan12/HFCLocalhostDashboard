But it inspired me to look a bit deeper and I found <https:\/\/youtu.be\/CoT5e40lrEU> which goes beyond tracking into projections in a really simple and clear way. I'll be trying it on the flying monkey and alleyway shots this week. I know Youtube is prob not the best place to check for solid techniques but I reckon I know enough now to see when something's just being drudged. Hope you don't mind if I give you a shout if I get stuck!",

Sarah messaged me from the film school late on Friday to say she hadn't heard anything but will get back to me hopefully again today.

Super frustrating as I know exactly how to do the clean up in terms of steps (like popping some roto shapes to mask anything moving for a good track, keying or rotoing the shadows and merging them back over the clean plate etc. ). Is there a more intuitive way to select the tracking points where I want to place my clean patch?
