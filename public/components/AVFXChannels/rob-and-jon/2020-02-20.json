In terms of denoise, that can help if you are using Neatvideo denoise, but standard I dont think it does much, and doesn't work all the time. A good video to watch is Tony Lyons video on denoise (if you have the time watch all his videos, best ones I've found to learn with, retaught myself keying with his videos in film school when our tutor taught us very quickly and went right over my head).",
