In regards to the branches you are talking about the ones at the top of the screen? those appear to be moving, so to clean those up unfortunately you would have to rebuild each branch area where it patches over.

I'm guessing I will have to play around with animating the ZDefocus node to match the change of focus - not something I've done before but I'm up for it. unless you suggest another approach.\nAlthough, just to clarify, am I removing the cameraman AND camera or just the cameraman (meaning his head when it enters the frame and his finger when it comes in to defocus the shot)?  I was prepared to do it for £0 (for a credit) so £50 is grand! Thanks.\n\nAs for my monkey shot, I was thinking of maybe using the marker removal node for the trees. I know its a lot of work but I'm keen to get a job - won't a more challenging shot get my reel noticed ?\nWorkflow wise - I'll just render dpx's from the footage I'm given to work on, denoise and clean up as normal. I guess you'll let me know what format to return the footage? Will I get a credit? And can I use the footage on my reel?  And is there a deadline?\nwetransfer  to <mailto:jjoubertcomp@gmail.com|jjoubertcomp@gmail.com>",

In terms of workflow, I would think it would be better for them to export dpx's then send those to you so there isn't a loss of information. I would assume it would be the cameraman and camera, but I think the main movement but the subject is in front of the camera. Zdefocus would be best, I basically learned that one with the video I had on youtube. The hardest part will be animating that in time the focus change.",
