I only ever did a roto\/prep job once, at One of Us, but they didn't have it back then. I think One of Us may use it, or some external work gets done with it. Problem is, I've gone to adjust some of the roto I've been given but if it has come from Silhouette I can adjust the shapes (or maybe that was the way it was given to us). Its always good if you are able to use it and can put that on your cv",
