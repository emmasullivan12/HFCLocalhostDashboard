Hope you're good and enjoyed the clear sunshine yesterday if you were in London.\nSorry I've been dead quiet - don't mean to waste your time or the mentoring opportunity. Had my art show launch at the weekend so had to do promo stuff in the run up to Friday and make an appearance to invigilate the show. All done now and I'm back on vfx cleanup duty!",
