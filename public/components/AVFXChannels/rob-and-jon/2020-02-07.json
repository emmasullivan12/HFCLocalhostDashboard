If the patches are sliding the first thing I'm thinking is that your card is not in the correct place. in regards to the floor, are you using a separate card on the floor compared to the card your projecting on the back wall? There is a patch sliding around the sandwitch board? Like I said yesterday, I would just roto this back on top of the patches, maybe using an edge extend in the a pipe so you dont get the people walking in the background coming back through. You've kept the woman with the long hair in, but I can bits of black from the background creeping back in as she walks past",

And for the comments. I want to start again with it with just 2d tracks and roto the sandwich board as you suggest. A classmate helped me put the projections in place but I don't fully understand the set up or why my patches are slipping - probably my tracks.  Waiting for the Hugo Guerra projections lessons to get a grip of that.\nThanks for the edge extend tip - not tried that before. May need to put it on hold to concentrate on any paid work that comes but will def get back to it.",
