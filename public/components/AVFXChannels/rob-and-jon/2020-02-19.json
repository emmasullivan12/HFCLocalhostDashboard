Because of a slight change in perspective the wall clean up doesn't work very well for the whole duration of the clip. I've found a lifetime range setting in the card properties that I'm using to project a second set of wall clean up earlier in the clip. Is that the best way to switch from oneset of clean up to another? I've tried using a switch node but can't seem to get it to work properly.",
