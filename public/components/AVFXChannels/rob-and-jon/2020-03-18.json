A lot of the big comanies clear out when there is no more work, the most famous being MPC. 3D are a bit safer, especially animators, but comp are always the first to go.",

Heard about MPC in Vancouver recently, pretty devastating but I think the industry's bounced back there.\nWhat's the longest you've been without work since you started working? The 2 weeks you mentioned before? Is the impermanence something you just get used to or ar you always on the lookout for a 'permanent' position, or don't they even exist?\n\nI've known going in about the short term nature of the work and figured experience at good studios with a good reel does the job of propelling people from contract to contract. Although the situation now might be very different. But we're all still consuming hundreds of hours of content at home I so can't believe episodic and regular tv work will dry up completely...but what do I know!",

        "text": "I thought when I looked into getting into the industry that things would be a lot more stable and long term than they actually are. No one really tells you what it is like at these talks and presentations, it is only if you talk to artists working that you really find out what the industry is like. I had no idea about freelance and all that. The longest I've been without work was a month. Happened 3 times. First time in my second year, I finished at jellyfish, didn't have many contacts and could not find work. So I took work as roto prep at One of Us after a friend got me in (keep making contacts at places, especially in the early stages this will help you get other jobs, make as many contacts as possible!). That lasted 3 months, they offered me and extension to work on Assasins Creed but then I got work at Lexhag as a compositor (connected through another friend from film school who recommended me). That was great, got me great work and great cg shots for my showreel. But that ran out end of Nov, that year they were recruiting for Pirates 5 or something at MPC, but I missed that recruitment even though people who weren't as good as me got jobs there and they progressed a lot faster after that. Working at big companies, people will always be impressed by that even if you aren't as good . It was quite frustrating for me for a long time. It was in my third year after working for Lexhag again (I've worked for them 3 or 4 times now I think) that after Poldark they ran out of work, got the Glassworks job but there was a 2 week delay. Then when that job was about to start, they delayed because the work wasn't ready, then a week later they told me the job was cancelled. So I'm now scrambling looking for work after nothing for 3 weeks, then another week goes by and almost about to take work out of london and suddenly Glassworks is back on again. Only 1 month with a possible extension at the end. I hated that job, their first time working in tv (they were normally commercials), I got a few offers after applying and got Bluebolt for 4 months. Bluebolt I got extended for a year 2 months into the contract which was great and very reassuring I was doing the right thing. Then 10 months later, 4 months before the contract was due to end they ran out of work like a lot of places at that time so they let me and 70% of the compers go with a months notice. I got work at Lexhag, but they cancelled less than a week before I was due to start. But a friend who I had previously worked with at Lexhag got me work at Peerless. That was month to month. Lasted 4 months then found out a week before xmas I was being let go. That was the end of my fourth year working. Then we come to last year, got some work at Lexhag, they wanted me back for a couple of months. Did a quick commercial job during that time which also shafted me with pencil dates. Lexhag lasted til end of April, they ran out of work, I moved to Technicolor (again through a friend recommending me). That went for 2 months, and I was renewed there in July through to xmas, but I had applied ILM not thinking I'd get in (Framestore had turned me down the year before for Avengers so I thought I had no chance with ILM). Surprisingly got the job at ILM, 2 months on Mandalorion. Took it and hoped for an extension. At the end they offered me another 2 weeks, with possibly more after that. I couldn't take the chance, but now after working at ILM a lot of people were suddenly answering my applications now. Got a quick interview at Framestore, they gave me an offer very quickly for 3 months and have been extended here twice now.",

Really get to know people and keep in contact, because you hear and get a lot of jobs through people you know. I'm always keeping an eye out for what jobs are around because if work falls through you may be gone, and need to find something quick but you'll also be competing with everyone else who has been let go (and it is rare that just one company lets people go, normally your competing with people from other companies who have just let people go). If I was single I'd be a lot more open to going overseas at short notice, but right now that's not really a reality. But once you get a couple of years experience, there are companies that will pay for your return flight to Canada, visa, your partners flight and visa, and even possibly your first months rent. A lot of places in Canada do that, and Australia. I dont want to scare you by telling you all this, but if I had really known what the industry was like  might have thought twice. While I was at Peerless I had friends who had better showreels asking me to get them in Peerless, because there are apparently periods every couple of years where work dries up everywhere and people find it really hard to find stuff. I find it a bizarre industry, but it's just about being smart and planning ahead. And saving for when things do get quiet.",

But if you want to stay somewhere, it generally means you wont be making great money compared to people who move around. And there can be huge differences in wages depending how you pitch yourself.

I’ve no idea where my talent lies atm. \n\nBut is it worth the trouble, and expense to find myself (@43 yrs old) repeatedly unemployed in slumps over many years.  Keep wondering if I’m better off going off to retrain as a plumber or something. Lost Boys will cost circa £23k plus expenses with no guarantee of anything at the end! And Escape cost £10k from what used to be me and my ex’s home. My vfx friends are horrified that I’m spending or even considering spending a penny more than Escape. \n\nAs you know my big idea was to study and make a totally fresh start in Canada but it sounds like they have exactly the same working conditions- the same precarious contracts youve experienced - plus minimal holiday time compared to U.K. - lol.  Having read what you say, I reckon the placement figures for employment the school gives sound impressive but maybe don’t give the more realistic picture of inconsistency of employment that’s actually  the case. \n\nI’m lucky that I’ll have a nest egg from the house sale :crossed_fingers:and decent settlement for a few years. To be honest I would happily work for free just for the experience. but I’m super keen to get a foothold in a career without leaving everything to chance or luck or the whims of recruiters. \n\nI was thinking of hacking the system to find myself and mates in the same position work by setting up an app for small scale productions (like indies) to find compers for small scale work - like the cleanup you found me with Alexander. Just a glimmer of an idea but what do you think?  Nuts? \nI’m easily distracted so realise it’s probably procrastination driving that notion! \nOr is it better to specialise - as a colourist or editor or  matte painter or in CG lighting?\n\nNo idea what the right thing to do is, especially now, but I guess all our journeys are different and I just have to start... and at least Lost Boys will give me good connections in my fellow students in another country...\n\nAnyway hope Framestore is letting you work from home and that the ILM magic keeps bringing good luck. I really thought a couple of good solid shows brought security and employers trust \/ commitment to much longer or permanent contracts.  Have to take the view that’s it’s a skilled but seasonal job with an uncertain income I guess, and think about a side hustle of some kind...\n\n",
