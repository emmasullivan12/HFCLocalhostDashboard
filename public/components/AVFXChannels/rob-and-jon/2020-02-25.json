Getting my head round my big house move, new part-time job and organising a small exhibition of my work coming up at the of the week is eating up time. There's a launch on Friday night between 7 and 9pm if you're interested, it's just a couple of minutes from Clapham Junction station. Let me know if you can make it and I'll send more details - would be good to meet irl - if that's okay in this mentorship program!\nTrying to do a couple of hours clean up every day on the film this week so hopefully I'll have some decent results to share by Friday.  But pls be patient if I don't - keen to get working but the timing for everything is getting a bit nuts rn!",

Not quite sure if I can make Friday yet but will if I can. The director hasn't given us a dealine on the cleanup but let me know if you have any problems for sure",
