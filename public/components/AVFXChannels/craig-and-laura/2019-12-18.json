I've heard in ILM, that cfx artists will do rigging too, but then in other companies, they are two different jobs? And then sometimes, in advertising, groom artists do lookdev too... does it depend on a company then for what pipeline aspects you're responsible for?\n\nAbout your reel, i did not get it nor the password... I just got a brief description, it would be great to see it though! these are amazing companies you worked at! Did you find it difficult to get into the industry at the beginning or moving from one company to another ( it feels a little bit daunting after hearing about mpc vancouver and I recently watched a documentary about rhythm&amp;hues too, it seems like vfx industry is a tough place to be, yet overwhelmingly exciting).\nAlso I'm curious what are the examples of Fx\/CFX work you would do in a company? Is all the work done in Houdini? and what is it like being a supervisor? I apologise for all these questions, it just all sounds so exciting :sweat_smile:",

        "text": "CFX borrows so much from different departments - if you're talking muscle skin etc.. then it can be very tied to rig and animation indeed so some companies might tie the two together more closely which may be what ILM leans toward. In MPC it was all defined under \"Tech Anim\" so fully seperated from any rigging \/ anim responsibilities, and the way we approach it at Outpost is similar to that. But as its so simulation based theres a natural route for Fx and Houdini artists to be good at it. I think for muscle \/ skin the anatomy and movement knowledge of a rigger with the problem solving and workflows of an Fx artist is an ideal combo",
