Hope you Christmas was nice though!\nthank you for sharing all the information, it definitely made me see things a bit clearer.\nyour showreel is incredible, the tesseract sequence in interstellar is one of my favourites!\nIt's interesting about lion king, would that mean that everything that comes under fx was done procedurally and mainly using houdini? or is it just too complicated to categorise everything? looking forward to see the shots though!\n\nmakes sense - the differences in cfx between Dneg and MPC... I definitely see myself going for more creature related work, but hey as a graduate i guess i can't be too picky :grin: i've recently started doing groom on a digidouble, would it be okay if i showed it to you some time soon and got some crit?",
