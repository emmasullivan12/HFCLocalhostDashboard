It's a very clean greenscreen so you should be able to get that. The new background has nice detail but I don't think the defocus matches the plate. You have the props in the background so they are your reference. Try using a zdefovus or convolve with a custom kernel so you get an effect that matches the plate rather than just a plain old blur.\n\nOther than that looking good!",
