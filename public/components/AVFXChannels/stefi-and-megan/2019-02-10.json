I studied Business Management as a Bachelor degree when starting out uni and then I realised I was more interested in people and how they work and what makes them tick. So I decided to study Business Psychology as a Masters and then pursued a course on Life Coaching and recently I started being self employed as a personal development coach where I help people go past any limitations they have, to achieve their goals and improve their relationships with others either personally or professionally. I was always curious to see behind the reasons why people do the things they do and was convinced that there is an explanation about anything..so I love searching for the answers hehe\nI would be happy to learn more about you, what your concerns are and things you'd like to have a chat about :smile: Feel free to ask me anything",
