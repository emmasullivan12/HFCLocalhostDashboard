I think my next focus, while I am waiting for the outcome of this interview, will be putting together a showreel for a specific studio. I think just trying to do a general showreel first is quite hard. So, if I can focus it for a certain place it might help decide what my best work is.\n\nThe interview was really interesting, and I think I learnt quite a lot chatting with people in person about working in VFX. I think I should focus on a showreel, and maybe learning a broader range of programs – I was recommended to learn how to use Nuke.\n\nIt was discussed in the interview that a lot of studios don’t really have VFX runners now. Do you know what sort of roles are seen as entry level, if it is not being a VFX runner?\n\nAdditionally, I know it’s recommended on this scheme that you get work alongside the work you get on productions. You mentioned that you were on a similar version of the Trainee Finder scheme, and I was wondering if it was similar for you? – if so, what had you been doing?\n\nBy the way, the café tip you gave was very effective!",
