This has helped a lot in reminding me of the experience I have. Instead of just focusing on skills I know I have, I think I should include experience that ‘shows’ these skills too.\n\nGood news! – I got shortlisted for an interview to be a VFX trainee with ScreenSkills :) it’s at their London office so I’m currently figuring out travel and money etc.\n\nI am going to look over my application to them and figure out what they may want me to elaborate on. I also need two written references to take to the interview, so I am thinking of who best to ask, and to ask ASAP!\n\nI was wondering if you have any tips on preparing for this interview? – It’s been a while since I’ve done a formal interview and it’s great that I’ve been given a chance, so I don’t want to mess it up.\n\nAdditionally, if you had any thoughts on references? – from their website, it says references can come from current and past employers, colleagues and\/or a tutor or mentor. I am thinking of asking the person who produced my short film for channel 4. Then maybe for my 2nd reference, my old tutor at university. However, it’s been a long time since we have spoken, and I have progressed quite a bit since then.\n\nThank you for recommending this scheme to me :slightly_smiling_face: it feels like I’m making some real progress now and I’m excited!",
