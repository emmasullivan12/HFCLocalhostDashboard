Especially interesting to know why being in editorial would be so data heavy – I had read a lot about this when looking at job adverts asking for this, but was not too sure how that would look when actually on the job. Also having this terminology for these processes is not something I have known about before. It is useful that you explain what these different terms mean.\nYou said somewhere before that you are interested in learning Python – do you want to use this knowledge for something specific?\nThank you, sending over a CV would be great! – Yes I understand about the personal info. I think it is useful for me to get an idea of what looks professional in this industry, it probably looks quite different than an art CV. I am thinking of sending my CV speculatively to some places in Newcastle and also maybe short placements in London. Though not sure if I should do more preparation beforehand on: CV, a reel or just learning more via emailing individuals. I am just keen to be learning and being involved now, but I do not wish to waste anyone’s time.\nI am coming from an art background so I am use to expecting most work coming from who you know. Most of the work I’ve got directing, exhibiting in galleries or residencies, have been from other people putting me forward (I am still trying to improve my networking skills – I just try see it as finding friends to work with and make cool stuff - this makes it less intimidating and stops it feeling forced).\nIn your job would you like to have more creative input?",
