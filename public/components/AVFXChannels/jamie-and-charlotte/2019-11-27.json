I'm really interested in knowing what day to day work would be like in VFX. \n\nI'm at the end of my studies and have graduated now.\n\nI was also wondering how important you think your CV is when applying for work? Do you think this was important or does it matter more about crafting a reel and networking (who you know)? - If this does seem important, I was wondering if I could see how your CV looks \/ looked? It is fine if not. I do not know anyone in VFX so I am unsure how this looks.\n\nThank you",
