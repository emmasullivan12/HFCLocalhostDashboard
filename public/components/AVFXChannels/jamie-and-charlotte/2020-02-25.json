All good now though.\nSpecific showreels is a good idea, maybe you could do a reel for groups of studios that you find you're applying for? E.g. an Animation reel, a Film production reel, TV studio reel?\nNuke is an excellent choice if you want to be a Compositor. It's very niche though and isn't used for much else. There's a huge shortage of compositors skilled in Nuke so I know why they recommended that haha! If you know some roles you're interested in then I can tell you what software people use for those positions if you like.\nIt's interesting that they said they don't have runners. I know many studios that do, in fact almost all studios I know have them. It may be called something slightly different such as Production Assistant but the actual role is very similar.\nYeah Trainee Finder means you're not actually supposed to undertake any productive work, everything you do is supposed to be for training although some companies are flexible with this. Where I was, I was allowed to work on the TV series they were producing outside of my Trainee hours. Also their placements tend to be short so then you can try and find a paid position in between. Although that can be tricky in regards to money and being able to live.\nNo worries on the tips haha. If there's anything else then let me know!",
