I do not know London well, so it’s probably best to be in the area an hour before! - Also to alleviate any nervousness.\n\nMy two referees have said they can provide me with written references, and I have finally figured out accommodation and travel. I am now working on an ‘agenda’ and practising this with different questions I might be asked.\n\nAlthough I have not been asked to prepare a portfolio, I wondered whether it may be useful to look over material I already have. I have looked online to see some portfolio examples in the past, and videos on putting together a portfolio etc. Do you have any thoughts on putting together a reel \/ portfolio for someone at entry level?\n\nHope it’s been a good week for you",
