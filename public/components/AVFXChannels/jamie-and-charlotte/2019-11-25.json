There was a lot of freedom in choosing what form of media to use in assignments with loads of tutorials and workshops for specific software or techniques such as chemical photography. It was a great course though I didn't really learn anything about animation and VFX as an industry, more about it as an art form. I was really interested in After Effects and how I could use it to create VFX for my projects, so I spent a lot of time learning via Youtube\/Video Copilot tutorials and talking to the tutors and technicians from my faculty. So my degree wasn't vital to me getting a job but it did give me an environment in which I could develop my skills and understanding of animation and put them into practice.",

I was mainly applying for runner or assistant positions and I eventually found a vacancy at Jellyfish as a runner with the prospect of helping in Editorial. There's a scheme called Trainee Finder run by Creative Skillset, which meant that Jellyfish could take me on as a trainee and I could still get paid which was vital for me as I had to support myself and couldn't take unpaid positions (of which there are many sadly).\n\nHere's a link to Trainee Finder in case you haven't heard of it, looks like it's rebranded to Screen Skills but still the same thing: <https:\/\/www.screenskills.com\/education-training\/trainee-finder\/>",
