If not then you could include it under a volunteering section? Or if you did then you could call it Additional Experience or something similar? I think if you can get as much on your CV as possible as long as it's relevant information, i.e. to do with film\/TV, and demonstrates some transferable skills. Though you don't want it too cluttered either so it's a bit of a balancing act. Feel free to send any revisions you want me to look over.",
