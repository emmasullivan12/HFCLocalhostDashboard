It’s really great to get some fresh eyes on it and all your suggestions are spot on – I’m going to change it all now :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nYeah I was not sure about putting the skill levels, but it is probably best to talk about the details of that in person as it’s quite a vague thing to quantify.\n\nI’ve done quite a bit of collaborating with people on projects, but they are all small things and not directly linked to VFX. For example, I did some test shots (cinematography) for a performer so I could advise her on lighting; I was asked for advice on how to translate a play to the screen and was part of their pre-research for this or I helped programme a screening event for a local cinema and did well-being checks, advised on how to make the space accessible. I’ve done lots of things like this, but I am never sure if it is relevant to mention, or how I would included it in a CV format. Most of these things were unpaid and for low budget projects too. Do you think things like this are worth mentioning? Or how to include it in a CV format?\n\nAgain thank you so much for giving comments on my CV - I feel much more confident crafting a prospective email to a local company now.",
