Story editing will usually involve an Editor with a bunch of assistants; 1st assistant editor and 2 second assistants along with maybe a runner\/edit assist. Depends on the type of production and budget on how big the team is. Story Editors usually specialise in a genre such as Drama, Documentary or Reality. Technical editing could include VFX Editor, Online Editor, QC (Quality control) or Mastering Editor amongst other things, all of which are highly specialised into a particular technical field.\n\nPython is a great tool to have, just means you can tailor your workflow yourself and be less reliant on others. If you are interested in Java already then it should be a bit easier to pick up.\n\nYeah I try to give feedback when I can and have some input. It's a tough balance between creative and technical in my current line of work but there are more opportunities in other fields such as Online. Might look at developing my skills towards that.\n\nAs for CV, feel free to send it to me and I'll take a look no worries. I wouldn't worry too much about the personal profile, I often think mine is too big. I would say only add things that you think would be relevant for the employer, don't just pad it out with filler.\n\nI know of a couple of VFX events and Facebook groups. I will have a think and make a list. Most of the events are London based I'm afraid but some do run things in other cities. Will get back to you on that.",
