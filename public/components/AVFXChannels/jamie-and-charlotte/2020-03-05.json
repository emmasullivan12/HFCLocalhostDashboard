If that makes sense. I know I work best when focusing on details for long periods of time; tasks that require a lot of patience and meticulously categorising things. Is there any common software in these areas that you think would be best to focus on first?\n\nUnfortunately, I just got back the outcome of my interview and it’s a no. They do not provide individual feedback, which is a shame, however they did provide some general guidance. I think I should have brought a showreel on a USB, even though they had not asked for one. When I have looked at the people selected for the VFX traineeships it seems they had already had direct experience working in VFX, and a highly related degree in VFX. So I am thinking I need to produce a quality 30 second \/ 1 minute showreel as a next step.\n\nI was also wondering if it was worth trying to get time off work and trying to find some unpaid work experience in London or elsewhere? Feeling a bit unsure about what to do next. I know I am excited coming up with ideas for a mini project to learn some new software (maybe even some VR content) and selecting clips from old films for a showreel. But I worry I will just keep self-teaching and not working in a team environment and not learning how to work in the industry.",
