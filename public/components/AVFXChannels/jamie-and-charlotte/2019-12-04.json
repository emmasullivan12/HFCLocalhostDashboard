        "text": "So yeah, Editorial is very much data transfer and a gateway for material to be received and also sent from a studio. Depending on the size of the company, we may be more or less involved with this. The larger studios have a dedicated data or I\/O team who do nothing but process the rushes, camera metadata, reference images etc. Basically anything needed by the artists and production team to create the VFX for the show. It was a little different in animation where the amount of data is generally a bit less and not constant. Usually handled by the Editor or one of their assistants.\n\nRe: Python - A lot of the tools that we use are custom made for each studio, sometimes by a pipeline Developer\/team or sometimes by the Editorial team themselves. Python is a great, fairly straightforward, scripting language which is used for almost all our tools as it integrates really well with Shotgun's API. This means we can communicate with Shotgun to convey large amounts of information to the artists quickly. Basically automating as much of the process as possible to save time and be as efficient as we can. Most of the scripts here at Milk are written by the Pipeline team and a couple by the lead Editor. On previous shows I have used tools written by previous Editors and sometimes the VFX supervisor. So pretty much whoever can create a functioning pipeline gets the fun task of working on that. It would be a handy skill to have as it would make me more attractive a hire and also more self sufficient, so I don't have to rely on developers for scripting needs.",
