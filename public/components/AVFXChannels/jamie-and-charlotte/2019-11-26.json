Or did you apply prospectively \/ or know anyone working there?\n\nIt's really useful to know you used Trainee Finder. I have looked at this previously though did not feel confident enough to know if I fit the criteria. I am looking again now to see if perhaps it would be for me. So did Creative Skillset (now ScreenSkills) assist in finding a position?\n\nWith your current job, what sort of things have you been working on this week? \n\nThanks for the help!",
