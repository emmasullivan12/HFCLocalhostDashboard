        "text": "Thank you for sending through your CV, this is very useful!\n\nIs editing split into these two types: story editor and technical editor? – I think I would like to focus on learning Python as I enjoyed doing bits of java for a performance and I would like to learn how to do more complex things.\n\nThat makes sense about creative input. It seems it might be more clear cut if you focus on data transfer and streamlining artists’ workflow. It’s nice when doing creative things if you have more overall control of your decisions. I suppose it can be quite rewarding if you can keep both modes of working alive, and probably keep a stronger insight into the artists you are working with?\n\nI am going to apply for the Film Trainee Finder as the deadline is coming up soon. I have found at least one place in Newcastle that I will send a speculative application to. Again thank you so much for sending me your CV – I think I need to make some adjustments to mine! My personal profile is quite small. Would it be possible for me to send you my CV for you to look at before I send it out?\n\nI heard on the Access VFX podcast about dedicated VFX networking events? So I have been looking into this so I can meet some more people in specific areas – are there any that you can think of?\n\nThank you",
