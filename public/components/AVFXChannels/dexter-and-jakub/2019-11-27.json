Also setting it up outside of school, I wouldn't even know how. I want to open up a business when I get older but than I would have money and  hopefully contact with people that could help me with that. Therefore working somewhere would be much more useful right now. Besides to set up a business I first need to learn how it works in a bigger companies so than I will have some idea on how I will want to run my business successfully",
