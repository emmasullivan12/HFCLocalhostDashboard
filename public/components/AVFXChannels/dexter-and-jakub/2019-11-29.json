I'm wondering because the Universities are so expensive, do you think doing an apprenticeship after the A-Level would be more helpful?  And than go to the University? Or will it be too hard to come back to the higher education? Because what I've heard is that people who are taking break and start to work after the A-Levels or College they struggle more when they go to the University after lets say 4 years because educations and curriculum changes every year and goes higher and higher.",
