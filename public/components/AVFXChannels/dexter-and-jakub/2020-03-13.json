The school itself does not consider closing down, unless advisied by a government body. Also if the closure happens we will be receiving all the work in the Google classrom and will be expected to complete it by set deadline. Moreover, all students across the country are advisied to stay at home and not hanging around the city. Finally, if we have an eldery person at home, we have to lock them up in a wardrobe and not let them out for 3 weeks unless otherwise indicated :slightly_smiling_face:. The last one was a joke. But that is it. Im think we got everything under control even when the virus will hit its peak in UK we should be okey, other than lack of toilet paper in shops :wink:",
