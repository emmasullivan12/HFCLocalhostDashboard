I wanted to show some more recent work on it but thinking back there is one part that can be replaced with work experience cause it doesn’t look amazingly impressive haha. They tried to train us while also make us do an industry standard project on the last 8 week course I did. While half the people on the course hasn’t done any VFX related stuff before. What a mess that was but I’m still glad I got a lot of comp training regardless. ",
