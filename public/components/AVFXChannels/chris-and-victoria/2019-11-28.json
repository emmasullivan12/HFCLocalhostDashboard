Still at Framestore looking at their resources, Ian Murphy replied to my email and said university of Surrey needs help with a project. I don’t really want to do the whole project alone since it’s currently 4 minutes long (and really crap lol) but there are like two shots which I could use to put on a showreel if I finish them well. Might just set up nuke scenes, ask them to cut it to a minute, and most of all on off days I can go there and help Ian with Nuke training and use their programs.  Nice on a CV and reminding Ian that I exist. Since I won’t be wanting to go to central London on days off (it’s under 30 minute drive to my house which is :ok_hand:) ",
