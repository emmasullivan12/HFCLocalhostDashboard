The other girl was called Rali, I believe she does rigging at MPC now. \nYeah I’ve always struggled with what name\/role to give myself. At NextGen I was tutored by Ian Murphy who is well know in the comp world and does advanced training at all the companies (which is why I made sure his name is in my showreel and CV haha) and he calls himself a Senior 2D trainer on LinkedIn. I think you’re right tho, it can be confusing. ",

I want to send applications to all the big companies like MPC, but since they can take a while to respond apply to smaller companies like Blue Bolt. Like I don’t really have a preference for movie or tv yet, although I find tv a little intimidating. When I watched Blue Bolts showreel they seemed to have one shot where they must have rotoed the two actresses frame by frame since there was a very small green screen behind them and the majority of the background was replaced.
