I think my reel is missing CG integration which is needed to become a compositor and not enough prep examples to become a roto prep artist. I was hoping to look through my uni work and salvage a project I wasn’t happy with. One of them is a projection of an alley way in Nuke, where we had to clean up all the mess and so on in Photoshop before projecting and so on. That definitely goes more into DMP though which probably isn’t necessary in a comp showreel is it? ",
