I can’t see any motion blur on your roto, which suggests to me that you roto without motion blur switched on (and again in most cases you need to be able to demonstrate your ability to deal with motion blur). Maybe pick a more dynamic movement for your roto shot - something that will challenge you more as well as capture viewer’s attention.
