So far I’ve done some post production work where I spent time with graders, sound mixers and a series of editors. I did actually spend the day at DNEG getting some insight into VFX so I have some idea of what happens in that part of the process.\n\nI’m currently just trying to figure out where exactly I fit in the industry and I guess with disabled access being one of my biggest hurdles it’s difficult to gauge how and where to start.
