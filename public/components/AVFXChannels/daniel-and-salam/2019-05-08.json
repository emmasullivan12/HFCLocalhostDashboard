Full timers only get about 4 weeks a year with only 2 week s in a row. So for some people it works out great , you work hard and get paid for weekend work then you have loads of money to see the world. A lot of younger people on my team do that.\nGetting experience at different studios is often a good thing too. So if you have a short contact at one place u can bounce to another and learn how they do things. It's also great for expanding Ur network of contacts.",
