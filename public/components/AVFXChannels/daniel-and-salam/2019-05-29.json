I really don't understand why I receive no notifications when you message, but I'll try to figure out how to switch on email notifications to solve it. What you said makes a lot of sense and does make me interested in that kind of work structure. Right now I've finished my design diploma, I'm hoping to get a distinction hopefully! Next year I'll be going to camberwell for a foundation as I haven't heard back from any apprenticeships. Do you know how I can get my foot in to a job in the industry for the summer? It's a bit difficult to find something for a runner or something like that. Do you have any advice?",
