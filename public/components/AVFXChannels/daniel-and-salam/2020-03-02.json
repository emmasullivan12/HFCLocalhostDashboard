Untimely though it's just about whatever path you do choose that you give it all your energy. For some university can slow their development down and for others it's just the motivation they need to get loads of brilliant work done. In this field though,  having a degree or not means very little.  You just need to prove you have the skills and the attitude.  But uni can be a great experience and fantastic place to meet people that you will know for the rest of your career. \nGood luck and let me know if I can help.",
