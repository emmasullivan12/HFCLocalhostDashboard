I'm essentially aiming to bridge connections between students from games related disciplines across the UK, as well as setting up some kind of talent-to-industry pipeline at one point. I have some further ideas for secondary and college education outreach but taking baby steps first. It's going well one day in but I'm wondering if you had any advice on maybe when the right time to reach out to companies to really bridge that connection?",
