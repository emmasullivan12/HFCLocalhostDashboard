        "text": "Hey! These are looking really cool! \nYou probably have done this but first of all I would suggest you find real world reference images for all the projects, whether you shoot them yourself or find them online (not just references from other films or video games). I always do this for example with lighting, even if the end result will be an animation. I find that way I'm more clear with what I want and how I want to proceed.\nI found the forest img dark and could use a bit more form. Be careful to not crush your blacks completely, unless you are doing it as a stylistic choice. The interior one with the wood panels on the windows is looking cool, is that the post apocalyptic one? You might consider tilting the camera angle to bring in an uneasy mood?\nFor point of interest I think probably the best way to start is to look at photography principles, like the rule of thirds or having lines (could be landscape) pointing to or guiding the eye towards what you want the audience to focus on as part of your story. Sometimes I draw tiny thumbnail img of my work to see if it is working as rough shapes and still holds interest. \nHope that helps, let me know if there was anything more specific you were thinking about or if I missed anything. \n\nGoing to add some links that will hopefully be useful!",

This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side. In cinematography, the Dutch angle is one of many cinematic techniques often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed.Dutch is a bastardisation of the word Deutsch, the German word for \"German\". It is not related to the Dutch people or language. It originated in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the Dutch angle extensively.",
