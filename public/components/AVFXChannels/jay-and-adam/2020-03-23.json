Framestore are mostly sending out Teradici for artists.\n\nThe main thing I’m hearing from my colleagues is that they’re having to use just 1 screen and it’s their secondary monitor from the office, so the colours aren’t as accurate as an Eizo.\n\nMeetings, including Dailies are being run virtually and everyone’s communicating through Google Hangouts.\n\nSo, the best advice I can give you for learning how we’re adapting right now is to limit yourself to 1 screen and get used to chatting with your friends by video calls.\n\nTo be honest, if you’re working on your final project though, don’t worry about applying restrictions on yourself, just work however you can.\nA big part of this job is problem-solving and adapting. Like, if you had 3D renders or a DMP that had some issues, can you do fixes in Comp saving hours of re-render time?",
