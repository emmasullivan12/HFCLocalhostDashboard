Glad to know you are doing well too. \n\nIt is an interesting time as we are expected to still work, but I think that given another week of climbing virus numbers, people will either stop going in or the government will step in. All pretty crazy. Even though many of us want to do a good job, looking after yourself and your family is the most critical. \n\nIf you do get free time from quarantine, might be a good time to do some work, but otherwise, enjoy your family time :)",
