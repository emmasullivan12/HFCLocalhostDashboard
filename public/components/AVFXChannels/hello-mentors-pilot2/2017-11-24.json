It's the weekend!\n\nDexter told me this was too macabre for a Friday night, but it's amazing so I'm sharing it anyway...:innocent:\n\nHere's a little Friday Find for you&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nI came across a Chrome Extension called *\"The Death Clock\"* :eyes: ... Every time you open a new tab, it displays the number of days, hours, and minutes left in your life, roughly calculated based on average lifespans. The line “Make them count!” appears underneath.\n\nLink here: <https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/death-clock\/nddjbfjdamhcmdcghehomomgppbigjam?utm_source=gmail>\n\nHope you have a fab weekend all. MAKE IT COUNT!! haha :muscle:",
