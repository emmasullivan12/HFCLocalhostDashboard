It covers anything from becoming an air traffic controller to going into the music industry. \n\nHope this helps! :monkey_face:\nD",

Get every bit of experience you can and then little by little you make your way to something more substantial. e.g. my first experience was on a fruit &amp; veg stall shouting out \"All for a £1!!!\"  :the_horns: That experience got me a contact who helped me get my 2 week school internship within business mgt of a banana factory lol :bowtie:",
