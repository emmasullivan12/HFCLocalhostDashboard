This means that they haven't been able to log in on time and\/or you might see a delay in the responses you get from them.\n\nWe had planned for some of you to take on more than 1 Mentee (where you had said you'd be happy to when you signed up of course :wink:), and the school IT team are fixing it so hopefully they'll all be logged in by Monday next week latest to meet you!",
