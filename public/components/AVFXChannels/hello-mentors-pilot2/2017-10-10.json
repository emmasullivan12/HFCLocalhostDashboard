Portsmouth isn't a big place and students that grow up there tend not to leave, so *this could be a big deal for some of our Portsmouth Students (even if they don't know it yet)* :confused:\n\n&gt;It's definitely a reminder that it is worth exploring your Mentee's motivations to join their chosen industries &amp; try to expose them to a range of other careers &amp; industries as well!\n<https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/7892c6f2-aceb-11e7-beba-5521c713abf4>",
