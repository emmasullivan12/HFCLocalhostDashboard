Pictures\/videos really do speak 1000 words :camera_with_flash:\n\n&gt;*Coleen* for progressing an internship within her company for her mentee. It's rare these students get a useful and inspiring work experience, let alone the chance to experience an architecture firm!  :classical_building:\n\n&gt;*Helen &amp; Christian* for going out of their way to recruit an additional E-Mentor to support their student - now that's what we call spreading the love :raised_hands:\n\n&gt;*Christian*, for being a speedy Gonzales. He's had 2 major projects come in this last month and 3 students at once this programme, yet his av. response rate was still probably within minutes!?? :rocket::flushed:\n\nAnd again a HUGE thank you to all of you for your efforts. We've had some really useful feedback and learnings from both mentor and mentees *(^^ KEEP IT COMING!! The feedback form link is a few posts above ^^)* :smiley::bowtie:",
