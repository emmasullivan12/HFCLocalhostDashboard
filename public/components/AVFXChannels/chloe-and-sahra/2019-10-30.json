So here is some feed back :slightly_smiling_face: I would say be careful when moving the shoulders, the rest of her core is still. If you sit at a table and do the same movement like on when she says \"hook up with me\" you'll see that there will be movement on your core and head too, try and built that into your blocking stage. Some of it is looking a little floaty so try and add in some weight and variety in speed of movement. I'd also say try not to move things at the same time and speed. If you look on frame 200 for example when she lifts her arm off the table, it's very linear. Hold it on the table slightly longer and start the wrist coming up and the fingers lagging behind. For the face I would try and get some subtle movements in there and try to lose the symetry in her mouth overall. I hope that's all okay. The basic ideas you have a really great!",
