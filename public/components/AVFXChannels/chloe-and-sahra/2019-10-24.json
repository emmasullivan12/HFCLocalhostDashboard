I wouldn't worry, life is generally a constant process and it's good to trip up sometimes haha, it's how we learn best :slightly_smiling_face: I very rarely draw because I'm not very good at it. If the shot is body mecanically heavy then yes I'll shoot reference but I only use it to get rough ideas of how to place things gravity wise. Reference can be dangerous because we're not pro actors so I find it better to use as just a base.",
