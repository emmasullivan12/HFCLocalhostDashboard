This yearâ€™s resolution is to become fitter and to improve my human body mechanics in terms of animation! Iâ€™ve got high hopes for this year :muscle::muscle::sparkles: Iâ€™m already starting on a good note as I managed to convince the local uni to have me attend some of their students motion capture classes! Today was my first session and it was totally awesome!! Do you do any motion capture at BZ at all? Iâ€™d love to hear your opinion of it and about your New Years resolutions of course! ",
