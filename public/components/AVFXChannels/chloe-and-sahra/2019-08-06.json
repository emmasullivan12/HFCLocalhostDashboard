It’s a very nice building, we had our Q-VFX launch there. Yeah I have heard that no one really reads cover letters, but I think it’s still a good thing to have one. It’s unfortunate because I think having a good cover letter is really important personally. \nUnfortunately I will be back home in France for the September 26th event. But I still recommend that you and Muniza go :) Otherwise I should be at the October\/November ones. I’ll see if our marketing person can put the facebook video up too.",
