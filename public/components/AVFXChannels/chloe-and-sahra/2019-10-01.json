I came up to Tom and said hi and that you mentor me, except I said Zoe first instead of Chloe then I corrected myself! After that I didn’t know what else to say and just awkwardly mentioned that we (cardiff Animation festival organisers) contacted him recently and that I was a volunteer. He seemed taken aback by that and then because of the reaction I kind of ended the conversation there and retreated ahahah omg I felt so terrible and unprofessional. Everyone there knew I was so nervous approaching Tom but they encouraged me to go up and that was what nervousness cost me ;;;; talk about a bad first impression :sob: ",
