We are leaving for Istanbul tomorrow so I probably won’t have access to the internet to respond, so apologies in advance! Omg thank you so much for the tips! I will work on my self intros so that I’m ready by the next VFX festival in early 2020! 2020 here I come! I am trying my best to find the time to work on a reel :) I have done some animating, but mostly blocking at the moment. I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you usually spend a lot of time recording references \/ drawing up storyboards or is this something left for another person in the pipeline? ",
