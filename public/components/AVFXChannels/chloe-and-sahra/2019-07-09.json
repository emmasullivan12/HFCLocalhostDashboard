I was called back there after that for a few more projects too which was cool. I am really ejoying working on Paddington at the moment, we just started our 4th episode. Tv shows suit me really well because I am a fast animator, I think that at the moment if I were to work in film I'd be bored. I like working quickly and efficiently. We usually do 5\/6 seconds a day on average. But I honestly believe that if you're organised well from the start, it's more than doable. It's normal to be slower as a junior though. You've just landed your first job, you're nervous and want to impress so you end up spending more time on things because you're unsure of yourself. It just comes with practice and good guidance.",
