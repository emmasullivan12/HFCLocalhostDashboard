I was wondering if you have any advice on how much is a decent salary to ask for as a junior animator looking to work London specifically. I don’t think I’ll be able to survive commuting to London from a nearby area on anything less than 25k to be honest.  But I feel as though I may be shooting over what most companies are willing to pay junior animators.  ",
