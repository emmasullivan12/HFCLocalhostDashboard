It’s really sad that she’s willing to ignore the low pay and hunger to pursue the career she loves :sob: animation studios should receive bigger budgets for their animators and cut down on merchandise... sadly, most of the profit goes to toy makers that are already big corporations that don’t need this extra stream of cash when it could be used to help get animators out of poverty. It’s honestly baffling seeing how under appreciated these highly skilled animators are. To the animation studios these animators are replaceable because frankly they have a large pool of wannabe animators waiting outside the door who are willing to work on an unliveable salary just to get their foot through the door... \/\/rant over :sweat_smile: ",
