You should just be very proud of yourself for actually going up and talking to him in the first place. Also, it'll give you a funny story to aproach him with next time. If I'm nervous about introducing myself to someone I usually try and find out a little bit about them wherever I can on the internet and then come up with a few questions to ask. People love to talk about themselves so if you find somethng that he did that you liked and would like to find out more about you can ask him about something along those lines. Yeah I cannot believe that it's October already too. Next thing we know it'll be 2020! Have you done anymore animating recently?",
