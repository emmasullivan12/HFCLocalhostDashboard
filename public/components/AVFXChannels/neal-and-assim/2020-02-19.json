The course is mainly focused on compositing but it supports other aspects of vfx as well. If it wouldn't be any trouble I would like to receive some feedback on my current showreel, <https:\/\/youtu.be\/R29P8iupUwI>.",

At around 0.21 there is a green highlight in the helmet too, but it's not obvious what in the scene would e green that causes that reflection. I would also take another look at the heat haze coming off the fire as it needs a bit of work. The catwalk shot at around 0.32 looks very dark and you are loosig a lot of detail which would be nice to keep. It's hard to see how good the key is when its this dark which i thing is what you want to demonstrate.",
