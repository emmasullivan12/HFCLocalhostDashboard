It's really good on the one hand to really get to learn everything in depth but this also means I don't think I will be able to pick up shots from you. I'm very thankful for this opportunity but I just wouldn't be able to give it enough attention to get a good result. Thank you again and I hope I still can ask you for some feedback for my upcoming assignments if you're not too busy then",
