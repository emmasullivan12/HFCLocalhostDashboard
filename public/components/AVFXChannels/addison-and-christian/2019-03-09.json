        "text": "Hi Addison, hope you didn't have a too stressful week. So I've played around with the geotracker in nuke and my main issue is I can't import my object properly. .fbx doesn't work at all and when I import my object as .dae it is tiny. I can still get a decent track with the tiny object with scaling it up but then Nuke just moves my object really close to the camera in 3D space. Which creates another problem. Because I need my rendered textures for my arm I thought I can import the object (arm) into nuke, track the arm, writegeo to export the movement, import that back into Maya, parent the proper modelled arm with the textures to the imported arm to get the movement and then render that and bring it into nuke as a img sequence. The problem with that is, because the imported geo is so small that nuke moves it really close to the camera and then the movement isn't right. It looks right in Nuke but the movement doesn't align with the video in Maya at all. Hope that kind of makes sense.",

Also Nuke can import fbx but I think it supports a really old version for some reason so might be worth trying to export an old version of FBX. Another way that usually works is exporting your object as an obj for geotracker. Alembic is great if you have animation on it but as it's just the model a .obj would be perfect  ",
