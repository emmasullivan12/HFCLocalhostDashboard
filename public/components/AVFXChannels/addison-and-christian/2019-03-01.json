Wow that sounds pretty cool!\n\nMy project is coming along alright, I'm trying to track an arm with tracking markers in 3Dequalizer and then replace that arm with a CG arm (robotic or whatever). I've done a few tracking tests and it turned out quite tricky to track an arm properly.\nI've also just this week discovered a plugin for nuke called geotracker which kind of allows you to track 3D objects in nuke. So I've been playing around with that a bit as well. Have you heard of this plugin or even used it maybe? ",
