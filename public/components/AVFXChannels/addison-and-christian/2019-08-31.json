I am VFX supervisor on a feature film which has quite a bit of VFX work to do, most of it is pretty easy just screen replacements etc but a little later on we have some 3D CG shots that we will need to do. I don't know if you'd be interested in helping out at all? It would be unpaid but an amazing opportunity to develop your skills and seeing what working on a proper production is like and you'd get plenty of shots for your showreel. I know you have quite a good 3D set of skills too so you can help out there as well if you like however it would predominantly be comp work ",
