My only problem is that I'm working in Austria from 08.09 till 27.09 and I'm starting my masters degree at escape studios on 30.09. I'm not too sure about the timetable yet but I think it's Monday-friday 10-3. If there is any way I can come in before in the morning and after in the evening and\/or on the weekends I would love to help",
