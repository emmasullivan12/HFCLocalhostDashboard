Fill me in with your news :smile: I have been a bit busy with some new clients I took over the last weeks and was very excited to help them through discovering their values and why what they do is important to them. After discovering these it's easier to rearrange their goals according to their values and make sure they are doing things that they love rather than going against them and feeling negative about their goals if they don't align with their values :relaxed:",
