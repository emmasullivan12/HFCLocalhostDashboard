So I have been working on a male anatomy model and have been even working on a character using smother artists concept drawing as reference. Had also done a couple of props when I had started learning modeling in Maya. Will share all the material I have worked on so far, tomorrow morning. Some are incomplete but might give an idea where I'm struggling :blush:",
