I'm working on the build of our Prospela web &amp; app platforms. So hopefully I can shed some light on these areas for you!\n\nI also used to work at General Electric (a large industrial company) in their Oil &amp; Gas divisions ... so can tell you anything you like about working with Engineers.\n\nIt would be great to hear a bit about your interests and what you would like support with over the duration of this mentoring programme (approx. 2 months)...?",
