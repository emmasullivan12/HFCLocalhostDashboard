While I think it would be an interesting approach to make a tool that takes in to account real world science, I'm not sure it would be very artist friendly. The artist would have to already have the knowledge of how a change in atmosphere or temperature would effect the look of the simulation. An artist is typically given a reference or a shot plate to match, so in the case of snow, would an artist be able to look at this reference and figure out what the temperature of the ground and air was? Also I would maybe say that wind in general is probably a greater contributor to the final look of snow that the general atmospheric conditions. But it is an interesting idea, I dont actually know how temp changes or moisture changes affect the look of snow. There is a great blog that I go to almost daily that you might enjoy if you're in to that stuff...",

There is a lot to work with there. Also the train in general could be replaced with almost anything else. The other thing I love about that ref, is the people getting hit by the snow. Not to say that you should incorporate people in to your concept, but having the snow react with something else in the environment.",
