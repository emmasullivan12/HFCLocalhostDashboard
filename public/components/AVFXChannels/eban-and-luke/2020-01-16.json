It so happens that a project of a similar nature has already been done in the past. Therefore a thesis based on airfield creation is not allowed unless using the previous dissertation as a foundation for further exploration. Having this in mind, I will continue to explore other thesis possibilities. If you have any other suggestions or ideas, please let me know.",
