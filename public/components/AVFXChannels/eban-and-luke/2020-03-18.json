Also, this upcoming quarter SCAD has shifted to full online enrollment due to the ongoing novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. I hope to start planning a new project in the next couple of weeks after I've finished transitioning my belongings back home.  If you have any ideas or suggestions on what I should attempt\/explore next, it would be much appreciated. I also wish you and your family the best during this outbreak.",
