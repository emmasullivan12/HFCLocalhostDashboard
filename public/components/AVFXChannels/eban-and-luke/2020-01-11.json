I'm hoping to solidify my thesis statement to begin working on the required four to eight projects. In search of an appropriate challenge and my interests, I've been considering working with vellum snow\/particle systems or water F.X. I would either like to work on a tool within Houdini or focus on creating an artist body of work.\n\nOne of my early tool ideas was the following:\n\nAn HDA tool used to generate snow effect within Houdini, based on more real-world science, i.e., Ground temperature, atmosphere moisture, atmosphere temperature, and other elements. With an end goal of creating two to five simulations based on different geographical regions.\n\nWhile a more artistic approach would be to attempt recreating a scene similar to the linked video:\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/V-Cb9x70gYQ?t=11>\n\nBoth of these are early thoughts, and I am very much open to suggestions on what the industry would find useful.\n\nSincerely,\nLuke Vuilliomenet",
