On a different note, I'm in the process of beginning a new Houdini project, learning the process of FLIP fluid and white water sim\/rendering. I have very little experience in this area, besides a few tutorials here and there. As I work through this project, I was hoping if you would be willing to look over the project and provide guidance on where I could improve. Thank you for any help, and I look forward to continuing our discussions.",
