Although I would say that Codies is not terribly \"employee friendly\". \n\nMy general advice for getting into games is:\n\n1) Make sure you're already doing something related at home - For wannabe designers that would be things like learning a scripting language, building simple but fun games with Unreal's Blueprints system, blogging\/vlogging your own reviews and analyses of existing games, getting involved in game-jams. Be careful not to get caught up on any one project for too long.\n\n1b) Get feedback on what you've done, work out how to make it better and demonstrate that you can improve.\n\n2) Understand that almost everyone starts as a QA tester and most QAs are doing it as a stepping stone into other positions, so going straight into the role you want is pretty rare. On the other hand, internships into QA departments tend to be much more freely available than others.\n\n3) Networking is really important. Most of the games dev jobs I've had have been thanks to me knowing someone that already works in the company who would put in a good word for me.\n--------",
