Il must tell you that I felt a little intimidated... Also, I applied at The Mill Montreal for a PA role, for which I didn't get shortlisted, however Marie-Helene submitted my name to interview again for the Asset Manager role. So this time I met with Anais and Lizzie, and also an adorable doggie that I had the pleasure to pet during my whole interview! :heart_eyes:  I preferred not to establish our first contact before today because I thought that it might look like I am trying to take advantage of our mentorship link to get hired at The Mill.",

        "text": "The situation has evolved since I wrote my application for this mentorship. At the time, I was looking for a job as a Texture Artist but I started taking short-term contracts in admin support to pay my rent. Virtually everywhere the agency sends me, the company wants to keep me haha! However, those companies are in various industries such as finance, insurances, etc.. nothing close to artistic! Even if the team is super nice and they offer me a great salary and a role tailored to my wishes, it will never be the field that inspires me. But all the appreciative comments I got on my work and professional attitude really lifted my spirits and it felt so good after all the fruitless efforts in finding a role as an artist!",

And since I had a wide experience in Admin support, I thought my skills could be of service in the VFX industry AND I could work in an artistic context: that is why I answered Marie-Helene's post on LinkedIn, when she was calling out for applications :slightly_smiling_face:  I really enjoyed both interviews, the company culture seems human-scaled and empathic. I like that. I trust that the best candidate will get the Asset Manager role, and should it not be me, I am sure that I was meant to go somewhere else. But I definitely will stay openminded when I look at career opportunities!",
