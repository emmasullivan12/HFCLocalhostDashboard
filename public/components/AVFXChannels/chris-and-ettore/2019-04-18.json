When we review reels these types of things are what we are actually looking for. We are not actually that interested in the model its self, everyone can model, but not everyone takes the time to do it well. When we see any model our experience will instantly tell us what are the problem areas of that model, and we will actually be looking at those problem areas to see how you dealt with it. What separates the best from the even better is how you deal with issues like that.",
