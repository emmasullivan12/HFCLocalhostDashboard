I have decided to try and essentially create a mechanics and level design demo by simply making one of the levels from my game. At the moment I developing the mechanics with unity, trying to get them all working smoothly with one another.\n\nI am also trying to learn substance painter\/designer in my spare time, I have done a lot of designer and only a little bit of painter. It would be great if you have any experience with those, to have some feedback on my substance designer materials.\n\nIt would be great to know a bit more about you as well.

Even if you end up working with something else in the future the development practices and understanding are quite transferable.\n\nI know at uni you will try your hand at a little bit of everything but its important to think about what it is you would prefer to do. Art, design, Programming etc. In smaller companies you might end up doing other things outside you main discipline, but it good to know which area think you would like to go into most.",

Complementing your art with a understanding of shader is good at this point and it might be something you really enjoy. One thing to remember with shader though is that fall more in to tech art than environmental art.\n\nWanting to start your own company is a good dream and something to work towards. One thing I would recommend though is possibly working somewhere first just to get a bit of experience so you can see how active development actually works.
