I’ve used the shots of my current reel that you said to use to form a short reel that is now And changed the front cover. Thank you for introducing me to the Animscrawl blog for it has a lot of useful information. I’ll be buying the subscription for the animdojo. I’m really glad that you have given me the info and will be sure to put it to good use. Feel free to send as much as you think I need to move forwards. Any other tips and tricks for me?",
