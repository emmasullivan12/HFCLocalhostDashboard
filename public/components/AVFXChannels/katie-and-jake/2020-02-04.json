This time we have turned to our new dedicated 2D animation studio who have created something very special.\n\nThe first 2D #BZshorts film is directed by People and Talent Coordinator, Katie Gascoyne. Our commitment to pioneering new talent and giving opportunities to ALL staff is at the heart of the shorts program. This year, there was a blind pitch where the whole company was invited to pitch an idea for the music video to Scouting for Girl’s Christmas single. Specifically, the brief asked for an “odd couple.” Katie won the blind pitch with a heart-warming pairing between Dan, a living gingerbread man, and his human girlfriend, Mandy.\n\nDirected By\nKatie Gascoyne\n\nStoryboard By\nLuke Allen\nJacques Gauthier\n\nArt Direction \nJacques Gauthier\n\nDevelopment\nAndrew Scott\nJovan de Melo\nMaeva Verdun\nAdam Willis\nLarisa Bumb\nFrancesco Guarini\n\nCharacter Design \nTena Galovic\nKatie Gascoyne\n\nProp Design \nEva Strautkalne\n\nIllustration\nSophie Gallo\n\nRigging\nPlamen Ananiev\nNiki Kehoe\nElijah Mazur\nSonia Naqvi\nGeorgia Read-Smith\n\nBackground Design\nSam Bailey\nKasia Brzezińska\nCharlotte West\n\nBackground Layout\nFarhad Chams\nSebastian König\nCharlotte West\nWei Wu\n\n\nBackground Paint\nAlice Geoffriault\nLucy Munro\nNiccolo Magni\nJovan De Melo Junior\nNicola Coppack\nKatie Barry\nMaeva Verdun\n\nAnimation Lead\nMateus Lima\n\nAnimators\nEmilliano Alcocer\nStefanos Chrysanthou\nMichael Logar\nLewis Nash\nMarcelo Perin\nGiulia Ranialo\nSaeed Rezvani\nBilly Shing\nJoe Sutherland\nFernanda Valverde\nEduardo Vazquez\nElnaz Forouhari\n\nComp & FX\nStuart Geddis\nMillie Spouse\nJodi Henry\nTania Maccaferri\n\nPipeline TD\nChris Carter\n\nEdit\nAlec Smith\n\nMusic\n‘Let’s Not Go Away’ a Song by Scouting For Girls \nMusic & Lyrics by Roy Stride, David Freedman, Jackson Freedman\n\nSound Design\nJohn Sutherland\n\n\n\n\nExec producer \nOli Hyatt\n\nProducer\nDenise Green\n\nProduction Manager\nNikitha Mannam\n\n\nSpecial Thanks \nTom Box \nAdam Shaw\nLaura Annis\nSony Music\nAll @ Blue Zoo\n\n\nMade by Blue Zoo Animation Studios\n© Blue Zoo Productions Ltd 2019",
