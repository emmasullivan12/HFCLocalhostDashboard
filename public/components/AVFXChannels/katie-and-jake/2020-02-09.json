I watched Let’s Not Go Away and it the movements + story reads very well. I personally love the idea of making inanimate objects to life and the scene with the coco is my favorite. I would love to learn to make 3D Animation look more like traditional 2D Animation. What makes something seme more 2D in a 3D space? I’m going to hopefully obtaining more time if classes don’t overload me with homework to work on animating since I’m noticing my speed and accuracy not quite on par level. I have a habit of picking things up quickly and then burning out, because I push myself too hard, so I’m going to ease my way back into it. I’m going to an animation club that will be nice practice and a learning or even a teaching moment. I’m curious as to what you do outside of your art life? Also I belive it is better to have a “wierd” work history than a blank or boring one.",
