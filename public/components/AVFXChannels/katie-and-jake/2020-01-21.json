I’ve finished the Animdojo Checklist, but I have not started any exercises, but I will send you my animation once I have made one. I should have at least Sunday for Animdojo. I’m super excited to animate characters and for feedback. I went to a Dreamworks talk today at my school were I met some people that are really happy to network with the SVA students. I’ve learned a lot about the type of animations I would like to make\/what TRipt Games makes. They call their animation style manga style; flashy and readable from a top down perspective, so I was wondering if I may show you something like that for feedback and also do a more open animation. I’ll be in touch, but I also do not seem to be receiving notifications. Also on another work may I see some of your work that you have done please. Excited to hear from you:smile:.",
