Instead of an illustration as your homepage, which I appreciate looks really nice but isn't super relevant to how you want to brand yourself, having a link to your showreel there would be best. I first looked at the website on my phone, and the links at the bottom for animation\/illustration etc aren't immediately obvious that that's where those projects are, so I didn't know where any animation was when I looked at it on that platform. It's only when on my laptop I was able to see where the animation was so bare that in mind. Make it as easy as possible for people to find the thing you want them to look at!",

The rest are either very abstract, exercises that are good for practicing (but are not showreel pieces, and we'll also speak about the differences between these later), or aren't relevant to the level of animation you're looking to showcase.
