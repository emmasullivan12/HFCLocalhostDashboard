My first 3D program was Cinema 4D in high school, and this year I learned Maya. I’m getting ready to apply for internships in L.A. after I update my website at <http:\/\/jakeleyva.com|jakeleyva.com>. I’m passionate towards some video games, mostly League of Legends, self development, philosophy, anime, and learning in general. My goal right now is to work at Riot Games or DreamWorks since I’ve connected with the League of Legends of Riot for eight years now, and the movies that I watched when I was young, touched my heart. Kung Fu panda’s Oogway is my favorite character since he is prophetic and has some of the greatest quotes. I also a non-conformist and seeking for challenges a lot. I would like to gain knowledge from this mentorship about Animation and how I may improve both soft and hard skills to make it great in the industry. \n\nWarmly:fire:,\n\nJake Leyva ",
