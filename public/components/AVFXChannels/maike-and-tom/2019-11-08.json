A little bit about myself, I come from a gamedesign background (5 years of uni) and have been working in a field of animation called previs\/previzualisation, that happens very much in pre-production for films and TV shows for another 5 years now. Can you tell me a little bit about your background and what you hope to find with this mentor program? Best regards, maike",
