Just thought I'd say hello since it's been a little while. \n\nA project I worked on over a year ago while at Milk VFX is finally getting released soon. It was a lower budget one, but I'm still excited for it. Michael Caine is the voice of the sandman character, and I had a lot of fun animating to his vocal performance. None of my shots are in the trailer, but just figured it might be fun to share:\n\n<https:\/\/youtu.be\/gH2qKK52E3k|https:\/\/youtu.be\/gH2qKK52E3k>",
