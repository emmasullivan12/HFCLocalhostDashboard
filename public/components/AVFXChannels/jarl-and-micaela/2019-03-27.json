I'm currently taking some paid time off before switching companies. It is so nice to have a whole week off! Next week I am starting a new contract over at MPC, which I'm excited about. Maybe if you want you can play around with the notification settings in here to see if we can chat a little more frequently? I've had some difficulties getting notifications working on my phone on here too. I'll take a look at them again and see if I can provide any tips. Hope to hear from you!",
