It is the first time they see my work on these shots, so this often feels like the trickiest point in a shot's animation progression, because depending on how they respond, if they don't like it, I could have to start over on a given shot. Fingers crossed they are pleased!",

Our wonderful CG Supervisor was Ceylan Shevket Jawara Rigging and Technical Animation done by Lasse Rasmussen Animation done by Jarl Midelfort Look dev was done by Justin Long and Boyan Baynov I was responsible for the modeling and texturing of the skeleton, muscle and actual fox. I also did the render, lighting, part of the look dev and comp on this breakdown. Thanks a lot to Clementin Massin for the great advice on the compositing. Rachel Ward , Cedric de La Forest Divonne and Jarl Didelfort did the animation of the actual movie.
