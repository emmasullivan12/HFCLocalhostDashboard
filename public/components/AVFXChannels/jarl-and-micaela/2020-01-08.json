I had the nicest days in Argentina (I’m back to London now), felt like I really needed that break and see everyone back again. \nAlso managed to de-stress and switch off about everything that happened. Although I was really sad, I think there is only one way to see it and that is finding the way to get a visa without depending on the company. I already applied to Bournemouth University so feeling enthusiastic about it.. and also for two other in the US just in case. Something has to turn out right :joy: \nThank you so much for your support!I will let you know how the interview with Goodbye Kansas goes. And all the best!",
