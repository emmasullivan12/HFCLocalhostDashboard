How are you?\nHere I am, I’m really sorry again to appearing after two months, it has been really busy, between moving apartments, getting used to the job, and some freelancing work (luckily in 3D so I got to practice a bit), but it has been really crazy in terms of not having time even to rest... \nBut anyway, this weekend everything has been better and I could rest and watch some Houdini tutorials to keep learning. Apart from that, everything is good, pretty busy but good. \nHow are things going in MPC? It would be my dream to work there.. I attended to a VFX workshop last Saturday by DNEG, which was really useful. I am also thinking on taking a Houdini course at Escape Studios which starts in July. Apparently the person who teaches it is the one who does the tutorials in SideFX (Houdini’s website) so it should be very good. \nDo you think it would be possible to arrange a call during the week so we could talk more fluently? \nThank you!\nMicaela",
