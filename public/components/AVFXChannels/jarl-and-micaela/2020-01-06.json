It's really unfair.\n\nI completely respect your overall point of view on this situation though. It is a credit to you that they offered you the job, and you should be proud of that! \n\nI am really impressed with your dedication, and I just know you are headed for awesome things in this industry, especially if you continue to approach it with as much passion and hard work as you already have. \n\nGoodbye Kansas would be a great opportunity too! That's such great news that you are receiving all this interest. You are clearly doing things right.\n\nI hope you have a nice vacation and some good rest in Argentina, you deserve both!",
