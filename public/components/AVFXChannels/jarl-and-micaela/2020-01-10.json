Good luck with the Goodbye Kansas interview! I met a recruiter from their Sweden location a few years back when I was still at Framestore and attending a recruitment event on their behalf in Sweden. His name is Anders Singstedt, and I think he's still there and is a \"Talent Acquisition Manager\". I don't know if it would help, but let me know if you'd like me to reach out to him on LinkedIn to put a good word in for you?",
