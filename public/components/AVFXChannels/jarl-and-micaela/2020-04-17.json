It was a stressful and busy couple of weeks leading up to lockdown, and then the birth of my son (!), and then the first few weeks after he arrived. We are so overjoyed with him. Thankfully the stress has cooled down and we're now in deep isolation in our flat learning how to be parents. My son and my partner are both thankfully healthy and doing well. I hope you, your friends and family are doing okay too?\n\nI stopped going into work a little over a week before lockdown, out of fear for getting sick and passing it on to my partner and baby. I also got put on furlough in the week after he was born, so have been trying to update my showreel in between changing nappies and helping his Momma out (she had a C-section, so I am grateful I can be around right now to provide extra support for her).\n\nHow have things been for you? What a frustrating situation to have just started your job amidst this pandemic! Are you able to work from home at this stage? I saw the UK furlough rules just got changed, so that anyone working before March 19 can now also be put on furlough, maybe that is important for your situation?",
