Especially baby socks and shoes, which apparently are completely useless apart from being adorable haha. Thankfully we haven't spent any money on those kinds of things. People have been very generous with giving us their no longer needed baby stuff, which have included socks and shoes, but also all sorts of very useful things. We have two baby baths already hehe! I'm so grateful for such generosity, we wouldn't be nearly as well stocked with baby stuff without it. \n\nThat visa sponsorship organisation sounds really cool! It sounded like the Matchmove position you were being offered by Goodbye Kansas was beyond an internship, but is it just a case of having Goodbye Kansas being willing to call it an \"internship\", and then it's fine?",
