Lots of time with family, but not so much time on my phone or email, so I got behind on a couple of things!\n\nI just reached out about you yesterday to a former colleague of mine from One Of Us named Jessie Hereng, who is a Lead FX TD over there. She got back to me right away today saying she'd be happy to try to answer some of your questions about FX\/Houdini education. She is very smart, talented and thoughtful, so I'm really glad she's happy to have a chat with you!\n\nJessie suggested you connect with her on LinkedIn, and then you could chat\/ask questions on there via the LinkedIn messaging system. All I told her about you thus far was that you've taken a VFX course at Escape Studios, and that you are now interested in a more focused\/professional FX education. One way to get the ball rolling might be to introduce yourself a bit more and describe what educational options you're considering at this point (and of course any questions you have). You both are super kind, so it should hopefully be pretty easy for you two to strike up a conversation. Here is her profile page:\n\n<https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jessiehereng>\n\nI hope she has some helpful ideas and suggestions for you. Let me know how it goes!",
