Haha baby clothes are very cute that is true :) I will be having a new cousin soon so I am very excited as well and every time I see baby clothes I think about that. Hopefully everything is going well! And will change your life completely (in a good way :grin:)\n\nAs per the job, yes. So what this organization does is give you an internship visa and Goodbye Kansas was okay with it. This was what happened with Framestore, since them being a bigger company they had so many rules about what visas can they have people aboard on and which not. So even if it’s not an internship, they didn’t mind calling it so so I could make my visa. \nI am quite nervous but I know it will be great and I’ll learn a lot! Obviously my wish of going for Effects is still going so I still need to do my own work and keep up my reel. But this is a great opportunity to get started! Yesterday I attended an event where they talked about Gender Gap Salaries in the VFX industry, and it was really interesting. It’s good that you always meet new people and find out more things about the industry",
