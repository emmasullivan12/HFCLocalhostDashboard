I am also very impressed with your persuing VFX by moving here to learn at Escape Studios. Did you hear about this mentorship program through Escape?\n\nGetting a work permit in any of those countries makes sense to me. Germany has several VFX studios, for example Trixter and Scanline, so I imagine that could be a good place to try finding work. It is also pretty close to the UK, which could probably also help with your plans to come back to the UK.\n\nMondays aren't great for me in terms of catching up, but Tuesdays and Thursdays are good. Does either of those work for you? I usually don't get home and finish eating dinner until later in the evenings (which tends to be around 9pm), would that time work for you? Alternatively, we could try chatting during lunch, which is usually between 1 &amp; 2 pm for me?\n\nHope to video chat with you soon!\nJarl",
