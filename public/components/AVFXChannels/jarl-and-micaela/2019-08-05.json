It’s always nice to go back and meet all your friends\/family and get quality time with them. \nI’m still thinking if I should go this year or not to Argentina since it’s so far (and expensive :see_no_evil:), so we’ll see depending on what I do next!\n\nThe Houdini course is at Escape Studios; all good for now :). The teacher is Mark Spevick, he is very good teaching and has been in the industry as well. So far so good, and he said we’ll be doing projects so I’m thinking of taking the ones I did last year and polish them\/add Effects; also so I don’t have to start from scratch and have time to get a reel ready",
