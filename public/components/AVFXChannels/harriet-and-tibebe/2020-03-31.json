        "text": "Hi Tibebe,\nSure!\nI have been in the VfX industry for almost 7 years now having started in 2013. My first role was at DNEG as the Recruitment Administrator so I support the rest of the team day to day. After a year I began interviewing candidates and helping look after the 3D team. I spent 6 years with DNEG and over the course of my time there I had the chance to look after the VFX film and TV divisions and also the Feature Animation team. I was heavily involved with the creation, development and running of the annual Greenlight Scheme where we offered graduate programmes and summer internships. Towards the end of last year I was approached by Union VFX and given the opportunity to join them as their Talent and Recruitment Manager. I have been with them for a while and prior to the unexpected development of COVID-19, I hired over 45 people and grew the studio to a head count of 100 people, the biggest the studio has been in a while. I also help out with the development of our artists, making sure they get the right support and training available to them. \nSo that’s me! I’d love to know more about you ",
