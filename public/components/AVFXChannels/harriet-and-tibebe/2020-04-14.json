Having now discovered a passion for VFX, what roles do you think you are more interested in and have you started using any softwares to create your own effects? \n\nYour film course sounds really interesting. Do you get to do some practical modules with that or is it mainly theory based?\n\nIt’s not plain at all! That is how a lot of people start out and you’re still really young so you’ve got a lot to learn! ",
