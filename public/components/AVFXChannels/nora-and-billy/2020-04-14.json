I'm Nora, 26 years old, recently graduated from the University of Sunderland with a BA in Animation and Games Art. I'm super passionate about 2D character animation (I also use ToonBoom) and that's generally the role I'll be looking to get into. When I'm not working on portfolio work and personal projects, I enjoy playing on my Switch, reading webcomics, streaming shows and movies (my SO doesn't understand how crime documentaries are my favorite thing to fall asleep to :thinking_face:) and cooking!\n\n I'm currently taking a year to research studios I'd like to work for and build up my portfolio to match what they're looking for. I've always seen myself as working in-house but it's really great that you're a freelancer because you can tell me first hand what that kind of life is like. It's even more interesting that you're currently with Sun &amp; Moon because they are one of the studios on my radar!:star-struck:\nI've seen that you'd like to start a little animation studio as well one day, coincidentally that is somewhat of a pipe dream for me too, so it would be really cool to hear what motivated you to consider it.\n\nAs for my goals for this mentorship, I'm looking for a bit of direction. I'd like to know how you got to where you are now. How to use the internet effectively to build up your network and get your foot in the door. What it takes to actually get that junior position? What made you choose the freelance lifestyle and why it suits you?   Ultimately I'd like to gain a swiss army knife of tools that will get me noticed in the industry. It's a bit bland and basic, I know, but I've left the nest and now I'm feeling a bit lost haha.:sweat_smile:\n\nI think that wall of text is sufficiently intimidating, so I'd just like to wrap up with I'm looking forward to getting to know you and thank you very much for taking your time to be my mentor! :blush:",
