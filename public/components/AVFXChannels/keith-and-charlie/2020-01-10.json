At 10 years old I met Pete, the person who organises the 3Dami camps, and asked if I could attend the camp. He was a bit unsure as they normally take students from 14 to 19 yrs. He told me about an animation competion run by Manchester University. So I got to work and made my first short animation (that's the planes one). I finished and submitted it just before my 11th birthday. I won the category for my age group and used that to get onto the 3Dami camp. So far I'm the youngest student to have attended (they bent the rules for me). The following year I made and entered the kiwi animation and was suprised to receive 3 awards (Overall winner of my age group, Best use of Blender, Animation of the year - which covered all the age groups up to age 19). Everything in the animations is made and modelled by me.\nI've done 3Dami 3 years running now. The 3Dami videos linked on my porfolio are a joint collaboration of nine students (so not all my work). But everything else on my portfolio is completely my own work.\n\nI've recently started making simple VFX and exploring putting my CG characters into real-world environments. I am also completely self-taught, I love coding and exploring AI. I'm fascinated with AI although getting it to work can be a big challenge! I also enjoy doing projects using my Raspberry Pis and Microbits.\n\nHope that gives you a bit of an overview about me.\nRegards,\nCharlie",
