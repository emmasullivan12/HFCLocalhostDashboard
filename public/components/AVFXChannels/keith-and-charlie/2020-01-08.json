I intend to be in touch with you much more.\n\nI hope you had a lovely time over the holidays and a happy new year.\n\nI thought it might be good to start off by sending you links to my portfolio, Youtube and Twitter accounts.\nPortfolio: <http:\/\/3dvfxkid.wixsite.com\/3dcharlie5735|3dvfxkid.wixsite.com\/3dcharlie5735>\nTwitter: <http:\/\/twitter.com\/3DVFXkid|twitter.com\/3DVFXkid>\nYoutube: <http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCb1Zux79t44RhBKplKFYMZg|www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCb1Zux79t44RhBKplKFYMZg>\nI don't put all the work that I do online as I'm constantly tinkering and playing around (while crashing my computer :laughing:) and I just forget to update it. Most of the work I do is in Blender.\n\nI also attend an animation camp in London each year in the summer where 3 groups of 9 students (including me) make a film from start to finish in 7 days, those are the ones on my portfolio marked 3Dami.\n\nI would love to hear feedback you have on the work I've posted? And if you have any questions about any of it just ask.\n\nThank you,\nKind regards\nCharlie",
