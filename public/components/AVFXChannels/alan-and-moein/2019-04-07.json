If not then maybe you could do less work on that side?\n\nOne of things we do at work is get the modellers to get a render and the reference pic they used and literally draw a line between a bit of the render and the piece of reference they are matching. That helps us see what they are going for. I think you're model looks good so far but it's hard to get a sense of scale. It all feels the same size pieces and repetitive. Could you break it up? Different construction techniques etc.",
