Assuming your aim is to recreate this location : I had a team of people on a similar scale project and they struggled. I would be more impressed if you added  buildings to this scene or added something else to it. Invisible effects that you can reveal. Overstretching can leave you with a half finished project :) if you feel. It's manageable then great I will do what I can to help. But my opinion is its a lot of work for one person :) ",
