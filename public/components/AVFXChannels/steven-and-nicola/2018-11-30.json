Currently I'm doing  a master in compositing at the National Film and Television School and my ideas are pretty clear. I'm not looking for positions now as I've still got one year of course ahead of me but as soon as I'm finished I will start applying but for now the school projects have 99% of my attention. Interesting combo for Blue zoo to marry lighting and comp, do you know why?",
