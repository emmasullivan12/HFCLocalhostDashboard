Most of the fx are environments and set extentions plus some simulation of an \"evil ice\" that crawls on objects and people. A mixture of simulations, CG environments and 2d assets to comp. I would have loved to have had a creature in the film though. It's being fun until now but I really hate to wait arround for things knowing that all the assests will come at the same time and then it will be a lot of work in little time but I guess this is how it goes for every project. I didn't even know that there was a new paddington tv series how is that is it closer to the film or to the original style-wise? I was also thinking when new people come to BZ do they have some training an if yes about what? I'll wait for news about the internship :smiley: Have a nice one!",
