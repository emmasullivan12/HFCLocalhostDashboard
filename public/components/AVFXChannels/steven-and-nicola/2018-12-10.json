It varies per project, I'm working on quite a small production at the moment, We're a team of 4-5 (5th person has moved on to another project) I'm one of two leads - the other is more towards comp, so it works well between us. We then have an artist each on our team, the 5th floats between where needed. It's hard to say for me; I've not done much live action - in kids TV we have a really fast turnaround, and there's much more colour and extremes of lighting\/grading. Compared to working in technology and corporate film, I guess there's not so much striving for realism, and pushing more towards surrealism, and of course gaining an eye for how to catch and keep a childs attention rather than an adults! Childrens TV was a personal goal for me and my works generally been towards the cartoon side :slightly_smiling_face: Blue Zoo hire a lot of graduates though, and many move on to work on feature films and vfx when that is more their calling!",
