Interesting, this artistic\/technical combo is coming up quite a lot when asking this question and I'm trying to figure out where I fit and on which aspect to concentrate to broaden the chances of getting in. what do you think, I'm pretty strong on the tech side, would you keep working on that aspect even more or would you try to balance out (and how)? Software-wise since I feel confident in nuke I've recently started a project in flame to get more tool-agnostic what do you think? flame artists at BZ? I've just realized that you might be able with this, I'm trying to solve an issue with the school animation pipeline (stopmotion) in regards to timecode into image sequence out of dragonframe (for conforming purposes), I see that BZ is doing some stopframe projects, do you know someone that might be able to give advice on how to fix this??",
