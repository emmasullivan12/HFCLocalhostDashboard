That is me yes! :] How is\/did the horror film go? With Paddington it's the same writers as the movie I think! We will try to keep it more to the origional - to look almost stop motion (less than we did with Diby Dragon, if you've seen it), and to be rendered in a way that shows it's from the bears memory, things he wouldn't remember are less detailed. It's been quite the challenge so far but a lot of fun! We finally delivered the last of Numberblocks so I'm a little more relaxed haha. For new starters they sort of learn as they go, they'll be guided by their lead for the pipeline and workflows, but generally need to hit the ground running I find! (and do). What are your current plans\/goals? I will try to be much more active here! Also heard you met someone from BlueZoo - Francesca? She was my supervisor on Go Jetters a couple of years ago, learned a huge amount from working with her!  Anyway I hope you're doing well!",
