        "text": "Hmm sounds tricky indeed! I have never used anything from Avid, is that where the data is getting lost I guess? The length is good, maybe a little long (generally 1-1.5 minutes is good for a graduate reel) so you could potentially condense it a little more. Watching a few times I get a little more easily distracted between the snow and running clips, but then the final shot is strong (although perhaps more because I am more CG driven!).  The title plate could maybe have less screen time (I know a few people that start to skip long title frames). I think the order is good, and it shows great comp skills as a whole",
