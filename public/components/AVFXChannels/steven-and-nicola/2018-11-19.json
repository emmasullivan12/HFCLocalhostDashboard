I got back into the studio today after a trip to the states :] From the looks of your profile it seems you have a very clear idea of where you're going! A little about me: I'm from a generalist background, primarily a Maya artist, and have been a lighter\/compositor at Blue Zoo since 2016. I see that you're looking to get into VFX for feature film, are you looking for roles at the moment, or studying?",
