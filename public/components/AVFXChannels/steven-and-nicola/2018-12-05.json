I'm more of a lighter myself, comping and grading is fairly new for me, but I really enjoy it, and have been pushing to develop it - though I only really deal with CG! Yeah, things in production seem to be moving towards real time rendering as well... not sure I'm wanting to board that train just yet but it does seem interesting, and definitely something to keep an eye on. This is my third production as light\/comp duo, from junior to now being a lead, and before that I was a junior generalist at a small technology company where I had a real mix of duties from modelling to simulations and motion graphics. aha no not awkward at all :] it is my first time as a mentor here yes, also not really sure of how it all works, or should work - I joined because it's something I'd have liked to have had during my studies, and after, to have a contact in the industry, some advice, and insight into how it actually is to be in a studio! I think I'm from a slightly different side of things than you are looking for - if I'm completely honest! - but I'm more than happy to help where I can, and hopefully can help you to open some more doors! What were you doing before this Masters course, if I may ask?",
