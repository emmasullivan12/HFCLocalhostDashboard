I hope things are settling down for you now. That sounds really cool, be sure to keep me posted of your progress on that. I have been watching The Expanse (now that they finally released s3 here in the UK), and there are some really nice VFX in that, more Sci-fi, but some gruesome scenes haha! What sort of VFX will you be needing to do for it? How are your other projects going as well? Yes, it's a great time to be here, we also recently announced to be working on the new Paddington Bear TV series! Very exciting times :] It's an amazing place to work for sure! We do run internships for sure, I don't think they have announced anything for the 2019 yet but I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything (and try to pester some people here for info).",
