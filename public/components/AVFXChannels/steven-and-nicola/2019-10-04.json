Apologies for missing you on here has been a very busy few months with personal stuff as well as work! The film looks great man! Some really nice shots, and a great overall feel, really consistent. How did your other shorts go \/ are they going?? I wish I could show you some of what we're doing here on Paddington, maybe soon we will get some permission! They are making a big push in to real time rendering here so that will be very interesting. Excited to hear about your experience!",
