If im honest im judging predominantly on the quality of the work they show and how likely I think that work could get someone a job. I would say that it appears Vanarts is the best. But im not sure the difference is that great.\nIm pretty wary of encouraging you to go for van arts as im sure its significantly mroe expensive, plus one of the most expensive cities in the world etc and a I say im not sure the difference is that great.  Also universities in UK you have the opportunity to properly visit",
