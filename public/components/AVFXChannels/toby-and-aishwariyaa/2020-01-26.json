Try to fidn the type of studios that interest you and really tailor your works to them. Obviously if that group\/style of studios is quite large it opens up your options a lot more. Its like people who have only interest in hand drwn 2d animation just instantly drastically reduce their career options due to the lack of studios doing that type of work",
