        "text": "so I kind of got into animation a little hap hazardly. Originally I was interested in doing architecture at university - but I didn't fancy doing the A level pysics that was required for that! honestly at that point I had never even considered that animation existed as a career. One day I was scrolling through the UCAS list of courses and university and I found an animation course.\nReally I ended up picking it becuase i like animation - i didnt think too hard about it. (I dont recommend this) This being said it makes total sense. I absolutely looove jurassic park's dinosaurs.\n\nAnyway I went to study animation at a college\/uni called Ravensbourne. Most of the way through uni I was very technically focused. I wanted to do character rigging etc.\nSo I graduated, with a very average looking short film and pretty terrible showreel :slightly_smiling_face: I was lucky to find a  few weeks of free training in a field called matchmoving (I'm not sure how much you know about VFX workflow? ) and then again I was lucky as my brother works in vfx also he maanged to help me find an entry job as a matchmover at Framestore!\nSo I was in the industry I got to work on a bunch of cool films while i was matchmoving. Buuut matchmoving is not the most exciting thing. I ended up sitting next to an animator so I was always looking over his shoulder to see what he was doing.\nHe recommended that I do a course at <http:\/\/animationmentor.com|animationmentor.com>. So this is what I ended up doing!\nWhen i was nearly done with the course I got my first animation job at a small studio that was doing a really low budget animated feature, I worked at that company for a year or so but the film never actually happened :disappointed: from there I jumped back into film VFX but i never maanged to get to work on many exciting projects. So I ended up doing a little stint of animating in games and then freelance animating at lost of small studios around london for a few years.\nEventually I managed to build a decent showreel and I applied for some jobs in Canada, and i landed  an animation job in Montreal at Framestore. From there I worked a little bit and then hoped over to MOC and now Rodeo FX (where i am now)\n\nIts very brief - but it gives you the gist!",
