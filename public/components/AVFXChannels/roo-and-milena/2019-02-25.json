Got busy with the current assignments and was ill. and to do with the final project, my point was to be able to create photorealism model from raw. due to the project being planned and started since December, I'm going to keep the current model I have. I have been introduced and given the softwares for photogrammetry from my uni corse around 2 weeks ago. I have now my real reference model person coming in tomorrow for better pictures to be taken. I'm aiming to get at least 60 pictures around the models head, in a professional setting with 4 LED lights and a DSLR. the progress and photos will be showed on my website.",
