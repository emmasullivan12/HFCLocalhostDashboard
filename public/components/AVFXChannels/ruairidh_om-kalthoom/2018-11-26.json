I have always wanted to be a modeller so its been an easy path for me to follow, but while learning the software and skills i have worked in bars, restaurants, call centres and clothes shops. Needed to pay the bills while i was learning as i didnt go through a university route i did self teaching. There was one point i though i would be a famous biker but that was just the madness of ebing a teenager",

I have a meeting at 10.30 am everyday in out mini cinema to have my work reviewed and will add in any updates or details based on that. Otherwise ite pretty much a free for all artistic creation as long as i stay close to concept . That pattern is pretty much the same for all departments",
