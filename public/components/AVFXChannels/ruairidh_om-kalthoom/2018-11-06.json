I use modo so i can advise you best on that but the tools and methods are very similar across all of them so its no issue no matter what way you go. I would suggest getting a free trial on <http:\/\/pluralsight.com|pluralsight.com> and then download a trial of maya and modo. have a play with them for say the first half of your month trial , then we can discuss how you feel about the software and begin some more in depth stuff",
