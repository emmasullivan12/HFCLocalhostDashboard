A little tip- if there's any points they made in the interview- advice, room for improvement etc, then make sure you do a bulletpoint response along the lines of 'You Said\/I did' to each eg *You said at interview I should include more X      *I did Y to show this'. Companies love applicants who act on their advice. Show character.",
