It sounds like you are doing the right stuff- answering practical problems like the Horse and Boat.  Also have you tried showing dexterity with other software (Phoenix, Bifrost etc etc)- so you can drop in comments at interview about your preferences and why- interviewers like to hear that kind of thing, even those who only use Houdini....Good luck- hope it went great at The Mill. If not, do continue the conversation and send me links!",

No I’ve not tried them out yet, would be a good idea.\n\nThe interview went really really well. They didn’t offer me the position. But said if I keep them up to date with my final project at Uni. And send them my grad reel in two weeks, they hope to make me an offer!\n",
