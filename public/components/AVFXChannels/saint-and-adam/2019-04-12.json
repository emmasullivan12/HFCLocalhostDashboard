Then to a masterclass I did with assists from DNEG. As well as a personal project of a boat dock. Which I took from fx all the way to rendered.\nThe second half is a tool I created to speed up the meshing process of water.\n\nI’ve been applying at all sorts of places. ILM, DNEG, Framestore. I’ve got an interview as a runner at The Mill on Monday",
