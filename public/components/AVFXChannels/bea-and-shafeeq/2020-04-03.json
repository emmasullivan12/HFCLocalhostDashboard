Pipe TD is a visual effect specific role so no one really knows what it is unless you work in the industry, it's basically software developer for the artists who work on our films, we write mostly python in response to really weird problems and software needs that come up during the course of a film being made.\n\nHopefully I have experience\/information that'll help you out with anything you'd like to know about, what sorts of thing are you looking to know?",
