I hope you do find an internship with one of the large vfx companies.\n\nLets look at what you have been working on.\nThis is coming together \n-I like the moody look that you are going for\nbroken glass\/foliage are definitely helping.\n\n-maybe you could work on making it dusty, grimy, old. how about a spec breakup and dirt especially on glass.\n\n-whats the area of interest?\nmake it stand out(expose up). look at some real photography on flickr or in a movie.\nif this was a set there would be softbox hidden off camera making that cloth brighter \n\n-color contrast: adding some blues in shadows (lift\/offset) and some more color in the moonlight(blue gain) would make the opposite colors of the foliage standout. \nJust have fun with colors. make a contact sheet.\n\n-let some dust catch highlights\/bloom\n\n\nnice exploration with depth displacement.\n",
