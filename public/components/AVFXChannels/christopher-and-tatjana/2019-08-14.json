Maybe we'll help each other haha \n\nI'm more of a character design\/concept artist person but there wasn't any mentor for that, I was studying 2D animation which I know Framestore does! I'm sorry if you have to go out of your way to help me because it's not your area of expertise.\n\nI'd love to know how to approach companies and what they look for in demo reels (I'm currently working on mine).\n\nI have to preface this by, this Sunday I learned that my school went bankrupt so I unfortunately don't have a diploma because we couldn't study there anymore. I know not everyone in the industry has diploma in their fields but it does help to have one... However, since I'm a beginner,  if it does stop me from being employable, I'll still take all of your advices, I just won't be able to act on them yet.\n\nAnyways! If you have any questions about me don't hesitate,  and do you like your current work environment :0?",

The more artistic it gets - i think at least - the less you actually need an official degree, but instead everybody is just looking at your artistic talent.
