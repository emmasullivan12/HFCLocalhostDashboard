It looks like a good start to your reel.\nI like the basketball sequence.  Nice choice of camera; I would always try and keep the camera moving, even if it’s a tiny move, or there’s a small feeling of hand held motion.\nAs a practice, try playing around with this sequence with different cameras, and coming up with different edits.  I don’t know if you use it but the camera sequencer in maya is fantastic for this.\n",
