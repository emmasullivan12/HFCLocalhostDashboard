I came to London 5 years ago with a passion for animation. My goal was too work for 3-4 years and then finally go to uni. This year I enrolled at Escape Studios (Pearson College London) and I'm doing the animation course! \nUntil now I was full time working as a general manager for a venue in London (doing events like weddings etc) but I'm been into management for the past 6 years. I'm a people person and a problem solver and I enjoy leading projects and having big responsibilities. Two things inspire me, people and animation! Combining my leading skills and my current\/future animation skills and make a career out of it is my goal :muscle:\nMy course is 90% 3D and 10% 2D. I can't really draw but I started practicing this year and I even bought the Wacom tablet pro. We mainly use Maya  for our uni projects but I'm experimenting with Zbrush and substance painter as well. This is my first time using a pen tablet and any of these programs but I'm trying my best to get better.\nWhat about you Lucy? I read your key skills in your profile but I would love to know more :slightly_smiling_face:",
