The change hasn't been here yet but will be soon as we must decide our university courses this year and start our applications now which lead me in debating my choice of course as it will be carried on for years. However I now have a clear path as to what I want to do now and of ever in the future want to change it - then I will, as a persons dreams and goals keep changing.\n     Have you ever had a change of passion or dream? And if so, what did you do? Also, have you fulfilled your expectations in your career as you had before? If yes, then what are your goals now?\n     ",
