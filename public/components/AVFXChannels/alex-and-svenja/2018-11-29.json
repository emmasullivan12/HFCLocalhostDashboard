Also, is it preferable to change a course once you have started it? As it may be considered time consuming.\n\n      Moreover, what's the difference between internship and work experience as they seem very similar, except one is done over a longer course of time.\n\n      I've been told adviced that in the area of technology, for of work experience it's more dependent on the programming one does individually and the terminology they use, we're about to start our programming project soon in December where the theme is open and wanted to ask for some advice on what project must be carried out.\n      \n      Is a gaming program more expandable in terms of programming and of which type? As I did some research where most game of adventure and action are famous but use rather very complex algorithms and codes, hence decided on a simple arcade game of maze to start off and build up. However is there any other project that would also be expandable? As well as how?\n\n      Thanks a lot for the previous advice Mentor.",
