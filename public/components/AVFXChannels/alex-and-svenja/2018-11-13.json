In this year I have to meet all the requirements needed for the entry for the university and course of my choice; for example in Imperial collage  to enter the Medical course you need to answer two external exams next year summer and also have some work experience. This is needed as in the start of our second year, we will apply to the university before we take our actual Collage \/ A-Level exams.\n\nAs we have to prepare the requirements this year, I'm still unsure about the course I want to enter for university where so far I'm being guided to take a medical course.\n\n However at the same time is there any way for me to also take a technological course? Also what will be the requirements?",
