The change management curve (<https:\/\/cornerstone.rutgers.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/Managing%20Change%20Curve.jpg>) is pretty good I think. I would like to believe that if there's change which I don't like but which is going to happen then I wouldn't follow the curve with denial, frustration and so on but often that's the case.",
