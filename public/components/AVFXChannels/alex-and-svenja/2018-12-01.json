We can't necessarily build on an existing game, however can base it on a similar concept and genre. It's an individual course work which requires a written report of the project - from the design, analysis, coding, testing, build up, documentation, evaluation and efficiency. We start the project at the start of next year with the timelimit being the whole of next year.\n      Due to some complications in my college myself and another student were placed in the class higher then our year, hence have been learning Visual <http:\/\/Basic.net|Basic.net> with them, which is IDE I'll be most likely to use.\n      I'd like to ask if an internship or work experience is necessarily needed if the experience can be obtained from home or college? \n       I'd like some advice as to how to start off the project as so far I've started off the analysis by researching the types of classic games that are famous to a targeted audience - in my case it's all ages hence a similar game to the Legend of Zelda. Therefore, a maze type game with a certain objective and obstacles to start off at a simple platform.\n      ",
