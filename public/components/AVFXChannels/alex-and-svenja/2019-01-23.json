I'm doing well, trying to cope up with all the studying as well as outer activities. \n\nMy Christmas break was very mundane as I had caught the flu which took quite some days to recover, however am doing excellent  and was able to create some handmade crafts that are to be sold in a volunteer project which I have joined.\n\nHoping you're doing well and had an amazing Christmas along with a wonderful start for the Year.",
