It's quite easy to answer what where using and why we're using those languages but that doesn't mean they are the _best_ languages. There are reasons for us to use those languages (I'll explain later) but in other areas, there are other languages which are more suitable.",

I'm working in the R&amp;D department and we're mostly working on fundamental problems which are very general and crucial performance tasks. So we mainly use C++. On the show side (developers working more closely with artists and specific shows), it's more python.",
