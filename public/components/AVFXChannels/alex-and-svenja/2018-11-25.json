The open days for all these universities is next year i the months of June and September. However there's an online open day of Royal Holloway coming up which I'm inclined to book.\n     Can you tell me which courses you took for collage and if you needed any work experience or internship for it? Also, does volunteering count as work experience?\n      ",
