After a year or maybe even after a few months you might notice that it wasn't exactly what you were after - that's fine! Be honest with yourself and follow what you want. Changing courses is very common. There's no point in sticking to something you don't enjoy. So try not to give yourself a hard time over choosing the courses.",
