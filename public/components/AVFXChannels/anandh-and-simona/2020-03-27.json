Also I would like to start and learn Houdini (which we don't learn at Uni). I know some companies are asking for Houdini too. And I want to find some good tutorials for that too. How is it where you work? Does an FX TD need to know Maya and Houdini or just Maya? Thank you. PS: I will ask you about my project in a few days.",

        "text": "I will definitely recommend learning Houdini of your want to get into simulations. It is the industry standard now.\n\nThe sidefx YouTube channel is a very good place to start. They have a good collection of tutorials covering all levels of proficiency.\n\nYou can subscribe to Allan McKay's videos as well. He does good simulation tutorials from time to time.\n\nApart from that, Todd Palamar is a good person to look for. He has a few good destruction sims on Pluralsight.\n\nFxphd is a very good source of directed learning if you're looking to start somewhere. LinkedIn learning (<http:\/\/Lynda.com|Lynda.com>) also has good Houdini courses.\n\nHope that gets you started on sims. Please reach out of I can be of any help! Stay safe!",
