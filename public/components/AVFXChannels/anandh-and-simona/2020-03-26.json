I also like Look dev. \n\nI am a journalist, and I have expetience in different areas of media and TV. In the last couple of years I've been a Digital Marketing Executive. I decided last year to do my Master in Canterbury. It was a brave decision since I already had a career, and a job. I gave up my job to follow my dream, to learn about visual effects. \n\nNow I'm doing a Spring project at home. It's mainly Compositing, but I would like to see if I can add 1 or 2 simulations. Unfortunately now schools are closed and I can't really do a lot on my laptop. So, I may not be able to do simulations. \n\nAnd in the next couple of weeks I would like to make a reel so I can apply to this summer internships. Though we don't know how things will evolve.",
