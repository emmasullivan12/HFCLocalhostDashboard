In uni I used to basically work non-stop, between 60 to 100 hours in the busier weeks. I graduated after 4 years never really taking a break. I would work during a lot of my breaks too to keep learning or to get ahead, aside from the summer vacation period. After graduating I went straight into a job where eventually I spent similar hours on a big project, between 60 and 80 hours. Before that project, it was between 40 and 60. It was a big animation project so it was a lot of fun, but at the same time very taxing on both my body and my mind. There were a number of external and personal factors as well that contributed heavily, but eventually, after 6 years of doing almost nothing but working, I burned out (no shit, you're probably thinking!). Anyway, burnout is _not_ fun, and it took me a few years to get back to where I was. It was around that time that the VFX crash happened in Hollywood as well if you're familiar with that, and that combined with the burnout made me change my attitude on overtime quite drastically.",

And it's true that they might let me go for it, but I realized that if that's how they treat their people then I don't really want to work with them.",

It was my first full-time animation job. I'd been working as a generalist up until that point, but I was kind of shocked to find that they didn't really facilitate overtime. It was possible, for sure, but unless someone had keys you had to be out of the building by 7 or 8 because the cleaners would come and lock up the building, and yet for the project I was on all the work was getting finished just fine, because they knew from the start how to plan and budget. That won't always be the case, and I've had some companies where schedules were all over the place, corners were cut, and deadlines simply weren't feasible, but that's *their* mistake. You can try and help them with it, but you have to remember that their planning, or lack thereof, is not your responsibility, even if they try to make it so.",
