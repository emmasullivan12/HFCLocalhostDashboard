You want to get the best out of it and I agree you wouldn't really have enough time to get things looking nice and polished. Doing pre-production is a smart alternative. I more or less decide on the same alternative while doing my specialization in uni. If you have any work to show that you'd like to get my thoughts on, even if it's pre-production, feel free to let me know. :slightly_smiling_face:",
