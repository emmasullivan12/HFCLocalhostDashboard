While I wanted to focus primarily on animation the time allocated for the project (8 weeks) was so short that it would not have been feasible. The option is now to work on making preproduction artwork either for a pre-existing short story or my own story for an eventual short animation after the final project. I will be trying to get animation practise where possible. More details coming soon.",
