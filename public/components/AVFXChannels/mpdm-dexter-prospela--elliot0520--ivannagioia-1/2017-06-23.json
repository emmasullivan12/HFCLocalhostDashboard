(like High School Musical: the movie:joy:)\nI also enjoy taking pictures a lot and I've thought about doing it as a career but I still love acting and singing at the same time.\nSo I really don't know what to do; be a  pop singer,  work in the world of the musical theatre and performing arts, be an actor or be a photographer.
