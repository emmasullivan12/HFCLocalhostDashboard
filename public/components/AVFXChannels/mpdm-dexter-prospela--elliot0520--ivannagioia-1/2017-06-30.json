        "text": "Ohh okay so work as a waitress but this week you have worked as a receptionist for work experience? \n\nIt's great you have such a passion for it and enjoy it so much, have you ever considered going into a job where it involves you speaking with people regularly? Sounds like you have a great team there! That's a really important part of work I find, getting along with your colleagues. \n\nYes it's certainly a rewarding career, it's very fun, but can get stressful working to targets but that's all part of the job! \n\nSo my job involves me calling up a lot of candidates CV's that I have on my computer. I download them off job boards, and LinkedIn etc. I can make up to about 100 calls in a day, when I find a good candidate I interview them (can be over an hour on the phone with them) and then I send them over to my clients to see if they would like to interview them etc. \n\nAbout once a week I get the train up to London, wearing a suit and go meet my clients, maybe new clients or ones I haven't seen in a while. This is to help me sell and pitch their business wel to candidates I speak to, and also to build relationships with my clients. If I have a good relationship with my clients they are more likely to want to interview my candidates etc does that make sense?\n\nSo lots of calls, lots of interviewing and a bit of computer work, admin work like putting information into spreadsheets etc, but I absolutely love getting on the phone and talking to candidates and clients, it's great fun!",

The way that you describe it, makes it sound so fun!\nYour desk is not messy at all! You have everything in its right place and you still have enough space to work comfortably.
