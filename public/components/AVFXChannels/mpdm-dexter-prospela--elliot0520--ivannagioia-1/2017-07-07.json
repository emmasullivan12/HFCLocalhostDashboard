I also looked at the photography course and it didn't really excite me as much as the musical theatre. \nI'm stilling not sure if i should go Uni or if i should do an apprenticeship. I had a brief look at musical theatre apprenticeship and i actually didn't find anything related to it, which it kind of disappointed me. \nSo if i don't find an apprenticeship related to it, i might just go to that Uni and do a sandwich course. The first 2 years doing the course then 1 year doing work related to it and then finally do my last year. But i still need to figure it out because I'm not sure.",
