Yes i do get nervous because when you are talking to all of them, they just stare and look at you, and i find it very uncomfortable but hopefully I'll get over it:joy:\n\n\nI have thought about working in films as an actress, but i don't really know the best way to get there, because its such a competitive industry. \nWow your brother also has a cool job!\nI think it runs in your family having nice jobs! Hahaha!\n",
