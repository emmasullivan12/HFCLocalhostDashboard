I just want to know exactly  what do I need to put in my reel to get me hired because I show people my reel but it good to get feed back but I can work on it another year and  still be in the same position . \n\nI ideally like to work on creature animation but do like to do character animation. \n\nI also like to be able to know how to do a a chase scene to a fight scene and I have seen films like Trolls to Toy story 4 and the flawless of the animation just makes me want to know how it can be done :) \n\n:) ",
