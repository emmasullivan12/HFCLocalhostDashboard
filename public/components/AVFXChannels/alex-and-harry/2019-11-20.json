We have a few people here that worked there before moving to Bristol that have given me some contact details. I'm not sure what the minimum age is to do placement there, but the email you'll need for them is <mailto:recruiters@framestore.com|recruiters@framestore.com> - and apparently the lady who manages this kind of stuff is called Amy Smith. I was also told that it'll be a good idea to mention Access VFX in the subject of the email, as Amy is also involved in the programme!",
