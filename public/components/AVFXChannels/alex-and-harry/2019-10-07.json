We were told not to be too \"precious\" about work, that's to say, don't keep holding onto work you're not completely satisfied with. I think it's always tempting to keep working into something, but the problem with anything creative, is that there's never a hard line where we can say \"now it's done\".  And yeah, those tuts are really dense with information, and some of them get quite deep into vex coding, but as you say, there's a lot of great key bits of info that you can quickly start applying to other tests and things. Don't worry too much about knuckling down and studying this stuff by the way, it's way more important to have a bit of fun with it at this stage. Play about and don't worry about making anything polished! As for licenses, it is a bit of a pain that many of the big companies still haven't come up with personal learning editions of their software, but Houdini's obviously got the right idea here.",
