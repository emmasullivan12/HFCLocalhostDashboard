        "text": "that's ok - Understandably you've got a lot going on, but yeah, it's really nice to be working at something you enjoy doing, and that made a huge difference to me after school. I was never very good at studying the things i found it hard to engage with. - that's kind of why I was keen to say there's no point in ruining the fun by making it into a chore at the moment, you've got plenty of time to causally just mess around with things.\n\n- I went to the university of Hertfordshire and studied a BA in visual effects, which i would thoroughly recommend. Its frequently listed in the top 3 courses in the UK for animation and VFX. here's their student reel - <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/264905924> here's their facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/uhanimation\/>, the other two courses that rank are normally Bournemouth university, which is superb for the more technical fx-y side, and the escape course, which i hear is great, but also very very pricey.\n- I didn't do an internship, but it was certainly encouraged. I think it's a really useful thing to see how a studio works, and interesting to see how teams work. A lot of my course mates had mixed experiences with internships, and i think it really comes down to where you end up on placement. It's important to be somewhere that's not super stressed and busy, that can make time to help you out and answer questions.\n- I'd started messing around with photoshop in school, probably age 14\/15 doing angsty\/angry teenage art. Good times! I had an embarrassing deviantart account full of angsty photoshop work, which i used to do after school. I also used to make little vfx tests and \"edgy\" videos, some of them are probably on my vimeo.",
