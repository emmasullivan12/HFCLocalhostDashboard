I use zbrush pretty much only as a remeshing scans, im a bit lazy, so i never learnt to sculpt in it. Mainly use mudbox for sculpting. I've been doing a lot of photogrametry, which is good fun - generating meshes just from photos. I use agisoft metashape for that. Other bits and pieces like world machine for terrains, a bit of nuke, photoshop, megascans mixer. You've got a big headstart if you've already been messing about in maya and zbrush. I think i started experimenting with 3ds max when i was 16-17, but a lot of the people in my class at uni were starting from scratch at 18. I was 21 when i started uni, and was starting from scratch in maya.",
