I did an AEC at Grasset Institute in Animation\/3D and special effects but was not supper satisfied at the end especially the Nuke part so I decided to go to NAD in the Nuke super intensive course with Xavier Bourque. He was a great teacher and tried to show us as much as possible with the time we had but there is so much more thing's I wanted to see and learn.\nI would of love to learn more on compositing and also VFX.\nI am at the age of 35 now finishing my demo but at the same time I guess I am a little afraid or shy and I have so many questions but in 1 year from now I would love to be a lead comp or VFX and in 3 to 5 years a supervisor.\n\nAnyways enough of me :) \nHow about you",
