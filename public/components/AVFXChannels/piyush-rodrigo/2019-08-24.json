Houdini is used in the studios for particle effects and simulations, which is a beast in it's own. I would suggest learn the basics and understand it's working rather than deep diving if you are not interested in fx (particles like smoke, fire etc) work. I will try to get some material on Maya API for you, mainly reading materials etc.",
